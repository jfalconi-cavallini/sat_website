The sentence provides a historical overview of the two theories, noting that scholars were divided between them before Ibn al-Haytham&rsquo;s experiments supporting intromission largely settled the debate in the eleventh century.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. While the sentence identifies the two theories and the scholars that supported them, it doesn&rsquo;t provide a historical overview of the theories. Choice C is incorrect. While the sentence indicates Aristotle supported intromission theory centuries before Ibn al-Haytham settled the debate, it doesn&rsquo;t mention extramission theory or provide a historical overview of both theories. Choice D is incorrect. The sentence provides information about intromission theory but doesn&rsquo;t mention extramission theory or provide a historical overview of both theories.</p>",
