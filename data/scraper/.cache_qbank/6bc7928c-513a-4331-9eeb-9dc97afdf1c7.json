  "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text&rsquo;s discussion of conservation approaches for the <em>Mammillaria </em>cactus <em>M. boolii</em>. The text establishes that <em>M. boolii</em> only grows naturally in the state of Sonora in Mexico, which makes it particularly vulnerable to extinction. The text then contrasts two approaches to conservation: the traditional single-species approach that individually focuses on at-risk species and a newer ecosystem-based approach that considers the interactions between climate, terrain, and various species in a geographical area. According to the text, conservationists have recently argued that this ecosystem-based approach may lead to better outcomes for all species in a location. If this ecosystem view is correct, then the single-species approach to conserving <em><span data-ssml-sub-alias=\"M\">M.</span> boolii</em> would likely fail to consider how the cactus&rsquo;s survival depends on its interactions with other species in Sonora&rsquo;s ecosystem.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because  the text doesn&rsquo;t address the distribution of <em>Mammillaria </em>species besides <em>M. boolii</em> throughout Mexico or discuss how that distribution affects survival. The text focuses specifically on <em>M. boolii</em> in Sonora and different approaches to its conservation. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t suggest that climatic changes in Sonora would reduce competition for <em>M. boolii</em> or that conservation efforts are focused on understanding this specific dynamic. In fact, the text implies that an ecosystem-based approach would consider climate among many other factors but doesn&rsquo;t specify how climatic changes might affect competition between species. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t suggest that the single-species approach would shift the focus of conservation efforts away from <em>M. boolii</em> itself&mdash;rather, it suggests that this approach might be too narrowly focused on <em>M. boolii</em> alone without considering the broader ecosystem-related factors that affect its survival.</p>",
