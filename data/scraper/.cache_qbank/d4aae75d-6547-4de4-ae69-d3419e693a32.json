  "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer. The convention being tested is punctuation use between sentences. In this choice, the period is used correctly to mark the boundary between one sentence (\"In&hellip;plant\") and another (\"By&hellip;weeds\"). The prepositional phrase beginning with \"by\" modifies the subject of the next sentence, \"she,\" which refers to Mac&iacute;as-Rubalcava.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. A comma can&rsquo;t be used in this way to join two sentences. Choice C is incorrect. Without a comma preceding it, the conjunction \"and\" can&rsquo;t be used in this way to join two sentences. Choice D is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentence. The two sentences are fused without punctuation and/or a conjunction.</p>",
