In the text, Gogol \"collects\" (or gathers) rocks and digs in the sand while strolling the beach with his father. Thus, \"gathers\" is the best answer.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because in this context, \"increases\" would mean expands or inflates, which is not something a child could logically do to rocks. Rather, the text indicates that Gogol \"collects\" or gathers rocks while strolling the beach with his father. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, \"makes\" would suggest that Gogol is creating or manufacturing rocks, which doesn&rsquo;t make sense. Rather, the text indicates that Gogol \"collects\" or gathers rocks while strolling the beach with his father. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, \"ignores\" would mean disregards or avoids, but in the text Gogol \"collects rocks,\" which indicates that he&rsquo;s engaging with the rocks, not ignoring them.</p>",
