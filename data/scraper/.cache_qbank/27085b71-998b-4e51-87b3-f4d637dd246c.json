  "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text, which is to foreground Queen Dido&rsquo;s strong emotional response to Aeneas&rsquo;s story. Throughout, the text emphasizes how deeply the queen is affected by both Aeneas&rsquo;s tale and persona. At the outset, the speaker explicitly states that \"anxious cares...seiz&rsquo;d the queen\" and then uses the metaphor of fire (\"within her veins a flame unseen\" and \"secret fire\") to evoke the warmth of Dido&rsquo;s feelings for Aeneas. In addition, the line \"His words, his looks, imprinted in her heart\" suggests the deep impression that Aeneas&rsquo;s story makes on Dido, eliciting passion for him (\"improv[ing] the passion\") and empathy for his suffering (\"increas[ing] the smart\").</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because there&rsquo;s no indication in the text that Dido is skeptical of Aeneas&rsquo;s account, much less that she&rsquo;s trying to conceal that skepticism. On the contrary, the text shows her being moved by his words and developing feelings for him. Choice C is incorrect. While the text mentions that Dido is impressed by Aeneas&rsquo;s \"valor, acts, and birth,\" which might suggest (but doesn&rsquo;t necessarily entail) intellectual engagement, the text doesn&rsquo;t represent Dido&rsquo;s engagement with Aeneas in a manner that suggests a balance between emotion and intellect. Rather, the text primarily emphasizes her emotional response&mdash;specifically her attraction to Aeneas and her emotional investment in his story, indicating that his \"valor, acts, and birth inspire / Her soul with love, and fan the secret fire\" and that his words and looks elicit passion and empathy. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t suggest that Dido is worried about Aeneas discovering a secret she is concealing from him. Though the text begins by mentioning Dido&rsquo;s \"anxious cares,\" this refers to her growing passion for Aeneas and pity for his suffering, not to worry about a secret she is concealing. The text&rsquo;s reference to a \"flame unseen\" and \"secret fire\" points to Dido&rsquo;s growing feelings for Aeneas that develop as he recounts his tale, not to a secret that existed before their encounter; moreover, the text provides no indication that Dido is worried Aeneas might discover these feelings.</p>",
