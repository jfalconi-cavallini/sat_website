Most speakers of Chinese languages reside in the neighborhood of Flushing (part of New York City&rsquo;s borough of Queens) and in Chinatown, in the borough of Manhattan. New immigrants from north China, where Mandarin is the primary first language, tend to settle in Queens, while new immigrants from south China, where many people speak Cantonese or Fuzhounese as a first language, tend to settle in Manhattan.

  "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer because it logically completes the text&rsquo;s discussion of patterns of linguistic distribution in New York City. The text explains how Chinese immigrants in New York City tend to settle in different boroughs based on their region of origin in China: those from north China (Mandarin speakers) typically settle in Queens, while those from south China (Cantonese or Fuzhounese speakers) typically settle in Manhattan. This pattern demonstrates that the regional language distribution in China (north versus south) has reproduced itself in New York City (Queens versus Manhattan). Therefore, it can be reasonably inferred that correlations between languages and regions in one country can replicate themselves when citizens of that country emigrate to a new country.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t discuss rates of language change. The text indicates that many languages are spoken in New York City, but it doesn&rsquo;t provide any information about how quickly these languages might be changing, either in relation to each other or compared to areas where fewer languages are spoken. Choice B is incorrect because the text provides no information about changes in vocabulary or pronunciation of immigrant languages compared to their original forms. The text only discusses where different groups of language speakers tend to settle, not how their languages might have evolved after immigration. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t provide any information about a relationship between a country&rsquo;s physical size and the number of languages spoken there. While the text mentions that over 600 languages are spoken in New York City, it doesn&rsquo;t relate this to the physical size of New York or the United States, nor does it suggest that large countries like China have more languages than geographically smaller countries.</p>",
