Instead, the information about Massey&rsquo;s socio-political focus presents a contrasting approach. Choice C is incorrect because \"as such\" illogically signals that the information that follows in the sentence is a direct result or logical consequence of the quantitative analytical approaches to defining space described previously. Instead, the information about Massey&rsquo;s socio-political focus presents a contrasting approach. Choice D is incorrect because \"likewise\" illogically signals that the information that follows in the sentence is similar to the quantitative analytical approaches to defining space described previously.
