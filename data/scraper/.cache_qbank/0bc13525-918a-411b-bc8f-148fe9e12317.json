  "stimulus": "<p>Historians point to the rule of the Piast dynasty as crucial to the formation of the Polish state. However, some differentiate between members of the dynasty like Mieszko II Lambert, who ruled as king from 1025 to 1031 CE, and less well-documented figures like Siemomysł, who is said to have ruled in the 10th century but whose historical actuality is disputed. Siemomysł appears in the <em>Gesta principum Polonorum</em>, a chronicle of medieval Polish history written between 1112 and 1118. However, the chronicle&rsquo;s documentation of Siemomysł relies on oral tradition, unlike its records of later rulers.</p>",

  "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer because it presents a statement about how historians view Siemomysł and Mieszko II Lambert that is supported by the text. The text states that the Piast dynasty had a number of different members. The text refers to two of the rulers in the Piast dynasty by name: Mieszko II Lambert, whose rule was known to have occurred from 1025 to 1031 CE, and Siemomysł (\"whose historical actuality is disputed\"), for whom less is known and who therefore is the subject of debate among historians. The text further casts doubt about Siemomysł by stating that he is \"said to have ruled\" during the 10th century, or the 900s, which suggests the possibility that he didn&rsquo;t rule. The text also mentions that the chronicle&rsquo;s documentation of Siemomysł relies on oral tradition, unlike its records of later rulers, including Mieszko II Lambert. This indicates that historians agree that Mieszko II Lambert was an actual historical figure, but they disagree about whether Siemomysł existed.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the text states that the <em>Gesta principum Polonorum</em>&rsquo;s documentation of Siemomysł comes from oral tradition&mdash;spoken rather than written documentation&mdash;unlike its records of rulers who came after Siemomysł. This suggests that the chronicle provides less reliable evidence rather than more evidence for Siemomysł&rsquo;s existence in the 900s (or the 10th century) than it does for later rulers like Mieszko II Lambert, who ruled from 1025 to 1031 CE. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates the opposite: Siemomysł supposedly ruled earlier in the 10th century, while Mieszko II Lambert ruled from 1025 to 1031 CE. The 10th century spans the years from 901 to 1000 CE, so Siemomysł is believed to have ruled earlier than Mieszko II Lambert did, not later as this choice states. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text mentions that information in the written chronicle <em>Gesta principum Polonorum</em> draws its information about Siemomysł from the oral tradition, it doesn&rsquo;t mention orally transmitted stories about Mieszko II Lambert. Instead, it states that the chronicle&rsquo;s documentation of Siemomysł relies on oral tradition unlike the records of later rulers do, which suggests that the documentation of later rulers such as Mieszko II Lambert did not rely on oral tradition. Thus, no comparison can be made about how convincing the orally transmitted stories of each ruler are to historians.</p>",
