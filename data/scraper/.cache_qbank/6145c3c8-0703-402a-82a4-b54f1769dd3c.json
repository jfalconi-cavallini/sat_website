The sentence provides an example of a fruit that contains vitamin C, noting that vitamin C (also known as ascorbic acid) can be found in pineapple as well as other fruits.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. While the sentence does explain that humans can get vitamin C from fruits, it doesn&rsquo;t provide an example of a specific fruit that contains vitamin C. Choice C is incorrect. The sentence explains why humans must get vitamin C from foods; it doesn&rsquo;t provide an example of a fruit that contains vitamin C. Choice D is incorrect. The sentence compares vitamin C production in animals with vitamin C production in humans; it doesn&rsquo;t provide an example of a fruit that contains vitamin C.</p>",
