  "stimulus": "<p>While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Digital Light Synthesis (DLS) is a form of additive manufacturing that utilizes light to rapidly cure liquid resin into high-quality, 3D objects.</li>\n<li>Step 1: Ultraviolet (UV) light images are projected up into a pool of liquid resin, where the object&rsquo;s first layer takes shape.</li>\n<li>Step 2: The partially cured resin object is raised, leaving a thin space (a &ldquo;dead zone&rdquo;) beneath it for oxygen and liquid resin to flow through.</li>\n<li>Step 3: The UV light passes through the dead zone&mdash;maintaining the flow of resin&mdash;and partially cures additional layers of the object.</li>\n<li>Step 4: When the resin object is complete, it is baked in an oven to complete the curing.</li>\n</ul>",

  "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer. The sentence describes how DLS cures 3D objects, noting that UV light is projected into resin to cure the object in layers, after which the object is baked to complete the curing process.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. While the sentence does describe some elements of the curing process, the description misrepresents information in the notes; this sentence suggests that the UV light, rather than the 3D object, is baked in an oven. Choice B is incorrect. While the sentence does describe some elements of the curing process, the description misrepresents information in the notes: the UV light, not DLS, passes through the dead zone. Choice D is incorrect. While the sentence does describe some elements of the curing process, the description misrepresents information in the notes. This sentence suggests that curing is complete when the already-solidified resin passes through the dead zone; rather, liquid resin passes through the dead zone and is solidified in layers, after which curing is completed in the oven.</p>",
