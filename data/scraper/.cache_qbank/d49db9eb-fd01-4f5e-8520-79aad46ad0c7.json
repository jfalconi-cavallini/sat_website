  "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer. The sentence presents both findings from the study, noting that FTWs using marigolds both removed phosphorus from the water and yielded market-quality blooms.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. While the sentence presents a finding from the study, the presentation is incomplete; the study found that marigolds cultivated on FTWs both removed phosphorus from the water and yielded market-quality blooms. Choice B is incorrect. The sentence misrepresents information in the notes. The figure of 52% refers to the amount of phosphorus removed by FTWs using marigolds when compared to the control; the marigolds&rsquo; bloom yield was 65 market-quality blooms per square meter, and it was not compared to the control. Choice D is incorrect. The sentence misrepresents information in the notes. The FTWs using marigolds removed 52% more phosphorus from the water than did the control, not 52% of the total phosphorus. Additionally, the bloom figure is incomplete; the figure is 65 market-quality flower blooms per square meter.</p>",
