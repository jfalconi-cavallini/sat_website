This choice correctly uses a comma and the coordinating conjunction \"but\" to join the first main clause (\"At...world\") and the second main clause (\"the...longer\").</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because when coordinating two main clauses such as these, it&rsquo;s conventional to use a comma before the coordinating conjunction. Choice B is incorrect because a comma isn&rsquo;t needed after the conjunction \"but.\" Choice C is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. Without a conjunction following it, a comma can&rsquo;t be used in this way to join two main clauses.</p>",
