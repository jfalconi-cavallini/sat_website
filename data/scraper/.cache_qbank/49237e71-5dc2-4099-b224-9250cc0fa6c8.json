The sentence contrasts the two samples, noting that the SEBS rubber sample, at 4 millimeters thick, was thicker than the TPU sample, which was 3 millimeters thick.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the sentence mentions a similarity between the TPU fiber and the SEBS rubber; it doesn&rsquo;t  contrast the two samples. Choice B is incorrect because the sentence indicates that both the SEBS rubber and TPU samples were part of the 2019 study; it doesn&rsquo;t contrast the two samples. Choice C is incorrect because the sentence describes the process of torsional heating; it doesn&rsquo;t contrast the two samples.</p>",
