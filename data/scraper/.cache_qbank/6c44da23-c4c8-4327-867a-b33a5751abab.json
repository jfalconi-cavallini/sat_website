  "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer. The convention being tested is subject-modifier placement. This choice makes the noun phrase \"pine trees and the fungus <em>Tricholoma matsutake</em>\" the subject of the sentence and places it immediately after the modifying phrase \"forming&hellip;association.\" In doing so, this choice clearly establishes that the pine trees and fungus&mdash;and not another noun in the sentence&mdash;are forming the networks.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it results in a dangling modifier. The placement of the it-cleft \"it is\" immediately after the modifying phrase illogically and confusingly suggests that \"it\" is forming extensive networks. Furthermore, it&rsquo;s not conventional to follow a long introductory modifying element with an it-cleft construction because it results in an unnecessarily wordy and confusing sentence, such as this. Choice B is incorrect because it results in a dangling modifier. The placement of \"the transport of nutrients\" immediately after the modifying phrase illogically suggests that the transport of nutrients is forming extensive networks. Choice C is incorrect because it results in a dangling modifier. The placement of \"nutrients\" immediately after the modifying phrase illogically suggests that nutrients are forming extensive networks.<strong/></p>",
