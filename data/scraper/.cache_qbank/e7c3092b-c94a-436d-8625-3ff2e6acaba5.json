  "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer. The sentence identifies chia seeds as having the highest magnesium content of the three foods, noting that they contain 150 mg/oz, which is more than both peanuts and almonds.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The sentence compares the magnesium content of almonds and peanuts; it doesn&rsquo;t identify which of the three foods has the highest magnesium content. Choice C is incorrect. The sentence merely mentions the three foods; it doesn&rsquo;t identify which one has the highest magnesium content. Choice D is incorrect. The sentence identifies the magnesium content of peanuts; it doesn&rsquo;t identify which of the three foods has the highest magnesium content.</p>",
