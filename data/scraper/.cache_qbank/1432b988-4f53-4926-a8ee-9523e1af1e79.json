  "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text&rsquo;s discussion of Peter Edwards as a portrait painter. In this context, having a \"reputation for\" something means that one is widely recognized for being associated with a particular activity. The text indicates that Edwards has created \"characteristic works\" including \"esteemed portraits\" of notable figures, suggesting he is known and respected for this type of painting. This choice clearly indicates that Edwards has established recognition or fame specifically in connection with painting portraits of well-known individuals.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text presents Edwards&rsquo;s portrait painting in a positive manner, describing his works as \"esteemed.\" In this context, \"complaint about\" would mean dissatisfaction or grievance regarding the activity of painting portraits, which contradicts the positive characterization of Edwards&rsquo;s work. Nothing in the text suggests that Edwards has expressed any dissatisfaction with or objection to painting portraits of notable figures. Choice C is incorrect because the text gives no indication that Edwards has a \"question about\" painting portraits, which in this context would mean uncertainty or doubt regarding this activity. Instead, the text presents Edwards as someone who has already created multiple portrait works described as \"characteristic\" and \"esteemed,\" suggesting established practice rather than uncertainty. The mention of specific examples of his portrait work further demonstrates that he is not questioning his portrait painting. Choice D is incorrect because the text does not suggest that Edwards has a \"requirement for\" painting portraits, which in this context would mean a mandatory obligation or necessary condition. Instead, the text indicates that portrait painting is something Edwards is known for doing well, not something he is obligated to do. The text describes his portrait work as \"characteristic,\" suggesting it&rsquo;s a defining feature of his artistic practice rather than an externally imposed requirement.</p>",
