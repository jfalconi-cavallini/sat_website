In fact, a species may have adaptations enabling it to produce a toxin with multiple uses. Finding that the venom used by the Panamanian scorpion <em>Centruroides granosus</em> to subdue prey also inhibits growth of the pathogenic bacteria <em>Escherichia coli</em>, Dumas G&aacute;lvez and colleagues conclude that the particular form of venom production observed in <em>C. granosus</em> may have propagated through the species because it mitigates risk during feeding in addition to enhancing predation success.</p>",

  "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most directly support Dumas G&aacute;lvez and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion that the venom produced by the scorpion species <em>Centruroides granosus</em> helps mitigate, or reduce, risk during feeding in addition to enhancing predation success. According to the text, G&aacute;lvez and colleagues found that the venom used by <em>C. granosus</em> both subdues prey and inhibits the growth of <em>Escherichia coli</em>, a pathogen that, if ingested by <em>C. granosus</em>, would presumably cause disease unless neutralized in some way. If it were true that <em>E. coli</em> is commonly found in species preyed on by <em>C. granosus</em> and, moreover, can withstand <em>C. granosus</em>&rsquo;s digestive juices after ingestion, this would suggest that <em>C. granosus</em> likely relies on another mechanism to neutralize <em>E. coli</em> to make <em>E. coli</em>-infected prey safe for consumption by the scorpion species. Given that, as the text states, <em>C. granosus</em>&rsquo;s venom was found to inhibit the pathogen&rsquo;s growth, it therefore follows that the venom provides protection for <em>C. granosus</em> against <em>E. coli</em> that its digestive system wouldn&rsquo;t otherwise provide, making it reasonable to conclude that the trait may have spread through the species because it mitigates risk during feeding.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because a finding that <em>E. coli</em> doesn&rsquo;t appear to be virulent, or dangerous, for <em>C. granosus</em> even when venom isn&rsquo;t used would weaken rather than strengthen G&aacute;lvez and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion that a particular form of venom production spread in <em>C. granosus</em> in part because it helps reduce risk during feeing, since this finding would suggest that <em>E. coli</em> isn&rsquo;t actually a risk to <em>C. granosus</em> when consuming prey. Choice C is incorrect because a finding that <em>C. granosus</em> can detect and avoid consuming <em>E. coli</em>-infected prey in the first place would suggest that an ability other than venom production is the primary factor that reduces <em>C. granosus</em>&rsquo;s risk when feeding, which would suggest there has been less evolutionary pressure to develop venom that provides protection; thus, this finding wouldn&rsquo;t clearly support the conclusion that <em>C. granosus</em>&rsquo;s form of venom production spread in the species in part because it helps reduce risk during feeding. Choice D is incorrect because G&aacute;lvez and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion focuses on <em>C. granosus</em> venom in relation to the risk of <em>E. coli</em>, and a finding that the venom also inhibits nonpathogenic (not disease-causing) bacteria species, which presumably don&rsquo;t pose a risk if consumed, wouldn&rsquo;t be relevant to the conclusion that <em>C. granosus</em>&rsquo;s particular form of venom production spread in the species in part because it helps reduce risk during feeding.</p>",
