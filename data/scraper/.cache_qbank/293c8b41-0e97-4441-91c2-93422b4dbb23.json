  "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most directly support the second research team&rsquo;s hypothesis about how a fish&rsquo;s head shape affects the fish&rsquo;s ability to detect obstructions. The text explains that fish detect obstructions using water vortices and that testing by Yanagisuru, Akanyeti, and Liao showed that fish with wide heads struggle to distinguish medium-sized vortices from general turbulence in the water. Based on this finding, a second research team hypothesized that in low-visibility conditions, wider-headed fish would be less effective at detecting obstructions than narrower-headed fish. The finding that wider-headed bristlemouth fish bumped into obstructions more often than narrower-headed dusky smooth-hound fish did under the specified conditions (low visibility with medium-sized vortices) would directly support the second team&rsquo;s hypothesis.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it would provide only partial support for the second research team&rsquo;s hypothesis. While this finding shows that wide-headed bristlemouth fish bumped into many obstructions, it provides no comparison with narrow-headed fish. The hypothesis specifically predicts a difference in detection ability between fish with wider heads and those with narrower heads, so supporting evidence would need to include data from both head types to allow for this comparison. Choice B is incorrect because it would not support the second research team&rsquo;s hypothesis comparing obstruction detection between fish with wide heads and those with narrow heads. Instead, it examines variation within a single narrow-headed species, which would not address the hypothesis about differences between fish with wider and narrower head shapes. Choice D is incorrect because this finding would contradict rather than support the second research team&rsquo;s hypothesis. The hypothesis predicts that wider-headed fish will be less likely to detect obstructions than narrower-headed fish in low-visibility conditions, which would result in wider-headed fish bumping into obstructions more frequently. A finding showing equal bumping rates between fish with the two head shapes would indicate no relationship between head width and detection ability, directly contradicting the hypothesis.</p>",
