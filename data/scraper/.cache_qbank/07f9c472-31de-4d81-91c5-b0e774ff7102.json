Choice B is incorrect because \"for instance\" illogically signals that the information in this sentence supports the previous point about \"the poem&rsquo;s exploration of temporality and identity\" by providing an example. Instead, the sentence provides a separate, additional claim about the poem. Choice D is incorrect because \"conversely\" illogically signals that the information in this sentence is contrary to the previous point about how Adnan&rsquo;s painting has inspired \"the poem&rsquo;s exploration of temporality and identity.\" Instead, the sentence provides a separate, additional claim about the poem.</p>",
