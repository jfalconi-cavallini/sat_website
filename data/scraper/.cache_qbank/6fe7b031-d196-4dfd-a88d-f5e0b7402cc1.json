  "stimulus": "<p><span class=\"paired_passage\" role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\"><strong>Text 1</strong></span></p>\n<p>One challenge faced by researchers studying global urbanization is that countries may define urban settlements differently. Many countries define urban settlements based on the number of people living in them. However, countries do not all use the same number; for example, Iceland uses a minimum population of 200, while the Netherlands uses 20,000. Other countries use a combination of population and other factors. This variation makes it difficult for researchers to compare aspects of urbanization in different countries.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span class=\"paired_passage\" role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\"><strong>Text 2</strong></span></p>\n<p>Recently, a group of six international organizations developed global definitions of common types of settlements. The group developed a new measure called the &ldquo;degree of urbanization.&rdquo; This new measure establishes global criteria used to define three types of settlements (cities, towns, and rural areas) and allows researchers to better understand global urbanization rates.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

  "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer because Text 2 presents a possible solution to the problem identified in Text 1&mdash;that is, how disparities in the criteria used by different countries to define urban settlements make it \"difficult for researchers to compare aspects of urbanization in different countries.\" Text 2 describes the creation of a shared framework for studying global urbanization: \"global definitions of common types of settlements\" and a \"new measure called the &lsquo;degree of urbanization&rsquo;\" that \"allows researchers to better understand global urbanization rates.\"</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although Text 2 mentions \"a group of six international organizations\" that developed criteria and a measure related to settlements and urbanization, no organization or institution is singled out to perform further research. Choice B is incorrect because both texts are about urbanization research and neither mentions any other fields of study. Choice C is incorrect. Text 2 discusses a possible solution to the terminological problem in global urbanization research, not additional areas of difficulty in the field.</p>",
