  "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer. The sentence emphasizes a similarity between the sculptures, noting that both <em>Uros Island</em> and <em>Fortuna</em> are LED light sculptures created by Grimanesa Amoros.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Noting that <em>Uros Island</em>&rsquo;s smooth LED domes contrast with <em>Fortuna</em>&rsquo;s tangled LED tubes, the sentence emphasizes a difference between the two sculptures rather than a similarity. Choice B is incorrect. Contrasting the respective sizes of <em>Uros Island</em> and <em>Fortuna</em>, the sentence emphasizes a difference between the two sculptures rather than a similarity. Choice C is incorrect. While the sentence describes <em>Uros Island</em>, it doesn&rsquo;t mention <em>Fortuna</em> or emphasize any similarity between the two sculptures.</p>",
