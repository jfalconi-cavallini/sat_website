  "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer because the quotation directly illustrates Patty trying hard to convince Mrs. Trent to allow the group to continue sharing a room. The phrase \"Patty did use all the diplomacy at her command\" explicitly shows her making a determined effort to be persuasive. The quotation further details Patty&rsquo;s specific tactics: she \"dwelt touchingly upon their long friendship, and their sorrow at being separated.\" These details illustrate the claim by suggesting that Patty carefully crafted and delivered an emotional appeal to Mrs. Trent about the effects of changing the group&rsquo;s rooming situation.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because although the quotation describes a reaction by Mrs. Trent, it does not reveal anything about the events or conversation that might have prompted this reaction. Instead of depicting Patty&rsquo;s efforts to be persuasive during such a conversation, the quotation focuses on Mrs. Trent&rsquo;s character traits; specifically, it describes the relationship between her \"sense of humour\" and her \"sense of justice.\" While the latter trait may be relevant to Patty&rsquo;s situation, the quotation doesn&rsquo;t show the extent of her efforts to convince Mrs. Trent to reconsider the change in rooming arrangements. Choice B is incorrect because this quotation describes the reaction of a group of three students immediately after an encounter with Mrs. Trent. It shows the outcome of an implied conversation but does not provide any evidence about the topic or nature of the conversation itself, and therefore does not illustrate Patty&rsquo;s efforts during a conversation to convince Mrs. Trent to change her mind about the rooming situation. Choice C is incorrect because although this quotation suggests that Patty can be assertive (she abruptly grabbed her friends and \"shoved them into the empty schoolroom\"), it doesn&rsquo;t show Patty asserting herself by trying to convince Mrs. Trent to reconsider the proposed rooming arrangements. The quotation doesn&rsquo;t allude to Mrs. Trent or to Patty&rsquo;s desire to continue sharing a room with a group of friends.</p>",
