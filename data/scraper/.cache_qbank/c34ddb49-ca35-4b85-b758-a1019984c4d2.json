  "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately states the main purpose of the text, which is to convey the speaker&rsquo;s longing for the ocean to impart a sense of inner tranquility, or peace. The text begins by expressing the speaker&rsquo;s strong desire to be on the ocean, appealing directly to the waves to rock the speaker to sleep. The poem then describes the \"slumberous lullaby\" formed by the sound of the waves and the winds on which the speaker wishes to be carried \"gently...between a peaceful sea and sky.\" All these details serve to emphasize the speaker&rsquo;s desire for the ocean to give them a sense of inner tranquility.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Given the poem&rsquo;s expression of a longing to achieve tranquility by drifting on the ocean, it can be inferred that the speaker desires to escape something unpleasant in daily life. However, the poem doesn&rsquo;t refer directly to any such hardship&mdash;ongoing or otherwise. And since the poem doesn&rsquo;t establish that the speaker is experiencing a desire to escape ongoing hardship, it can&rsquo;t be said that such a desire increases in intensity. Choice B is incorrect. The speaker does express a desire for the serenity of being rocked to sleep by the ocean, and it can be inferred that this desire is a response to demands that make the speaker&rsquo;s daily life stressful. However, the poem doesn&rsquo;t refer directly to such demands or contrast them with the tranquility of drifting on the ocean. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t suggest the speaker has any qualms, or reservations, about being transported by the ocean. On the contrary, the speaker actively desires to \"drift far out\" and be carried by the waves and wind. Moreover, the poem doesn&rsquo;t suggest that this drifting would have any particular destination.</p>",
