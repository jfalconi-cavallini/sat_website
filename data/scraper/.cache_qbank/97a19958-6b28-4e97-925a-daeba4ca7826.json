  "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer. The convention being tested is end-of-sentence punctuation. This choice correctly uses a question mark to punctuate the interrogative sentence \"where did the word &lsquo;chortle&rsquo; come from,\" which asks a direct question.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because a period can&rsquo;t be used in this way to punctuate an interrogative sentence, such as \"where did the word &lsquo;chortle&rsquo; come from.\" Choice B is incorrect because \"where the word &lsquo;chortle&rsquo; did come from\" does not follow the conventional structure of a direct question in Standard English. It&rsquo;s conventional in Standard English to follow the interrogative word \"where\" with an auxiliary verb (such as \"did\") when asking a direct question. Choice D is incorrect because \"where the word &lsquo;chortle&rsquo; come from\" does not follow the conventional structure of a direct question in Standard English. It&rsquo;s conventional in Standard English to follow the interrogative word \"where\" with an auxiliary verb (such as \"did\") when asking a direct question. Furthermore, a period can&rsquo;t be used in this way to punctuate an interrogative sentence.</p>",
