Instead, the removal of the cloth is the final step in the dyeing process. Choice B is incorrect because \"likewise\" illogically signals that the information in this sentence is similar to the previous information about simmering the cloth in the dyebath. Instead, the removal of the cloth is the final step in the dyeing process.
