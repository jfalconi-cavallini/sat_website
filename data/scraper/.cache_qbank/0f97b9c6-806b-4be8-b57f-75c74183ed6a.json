  "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of punctuation in a sentence. This choice correctly uses a comma to separate the supplementary adverb \"though\" from the preceding main clause (\"Such interpretations are ultimately speculative\") and uses a semicolon to join the next main clause (\"the object&rsquo;s...makeup\") to the rest of the sentence. Further, placing the semicolon after \"though\" indicates that the information in the preceding main clause (interpretations of an outer solar system object&rsquo;s composition based on its color are ultimately speculative) is a qualification of the information in the previous sentence (the composition of an outer solar system object is suggested by its color).</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it fails to mark the boundary between the two main clauses with appropriate punctuation. Choice C is incorrect because placing the semicolon after \"speculative\" illogically indicates that the information in the next main clause (\"the object&rsquo;s...makeup\") is a qualification of the information in the previous clause (\"Such...speculative\"). Choice D is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. Commas can&rsquo;t be used in this way to punctuate a supplementary word or phrase between two main clauses.</p>",
