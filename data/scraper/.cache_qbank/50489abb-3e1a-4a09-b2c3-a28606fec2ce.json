  "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer. The sentence provides an overview of the Haber-Bosch process, explaining that it uses an iron catalyst, high temperatures, and high pressures to manufacture ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. While the sentence identifies some of the process&rsquo;s required components (nitrogen, hydrogen, and an iron catalyst), the overview is incomplete; it doesn&rsquo;t explain what the process does (produces ammonia) or mention the conditions needed for it to function (high temperatures and pressures). Choice C is incorrect. While the sentence indicates who invented the process (Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch) and that it produces ammonia, the overview is incomplete; it doesn&rsquo;t mention any of the necessary ingredients or conditions. Choice D is incorrect. While the sentence mentions the inventors of the process along with the required conditions (high temperatures and pressures), it doesn&rsquo;t explain that the process produces ammonia or indicate what components are needed.</p>",
