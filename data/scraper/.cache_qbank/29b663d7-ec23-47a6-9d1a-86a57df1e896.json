Instead, the claim that the weight of the suit&rsquo;s rhinestones limited movement contrasts with the previous information about the jumpsuit&rsquo;s flexibility. Choice B is incorrect because \"firstly\" illogically signals that the claim in this sentence is the first in a series of claims about the jumpsuit being flexible enough for Elvis&rsquo;s dance moves. Instead, the claim that the weight of the suit&rsquo;s rhinestones limited movement contrasts with the previous information about the jumpsuit&rsquo;s flexibility. Choice D is incorrect because \"in other words\" illogically signals that the claim in this sentence is a paraphrase or restatement of the previous information about the material being flexible enough for Elvis&rsquo;s dance moves. Instead, the claim that the weight of the suit&rsquo;s rhinestones limited movement contrasts with the previous information about the jumpsuit&rsquo;s flexibility.</p>",
