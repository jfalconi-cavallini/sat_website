  "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer. The convention being tested is punctuation use between sentences. This choice correctly uses a period to mark the boundary between one sentence (\"The pedagogy...tenets\") and another (\"Developed...&lsquo;March in G&rsquo;\"). The participial phrase \"developed by Japanese violinist Shinichi Suzuki\" modifies the subject of the next sentence, \"the method.\"</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentence. The sentences (\"The pedagogy...tenets\" and \"Developed...&lsquo;March in G&rsquo;\") are fused without punctuation and/or a conjunction. Choice C is incorrect because it creates a confusing and illogical sentence structure. The relative pronoun \"that\" followed by a comma can&rsquo;t be used in this way to mark the boundary between sentences. Choice D is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. A comma can&rsquo;t be used in this way to mark the boundary between sentences.</p>",
