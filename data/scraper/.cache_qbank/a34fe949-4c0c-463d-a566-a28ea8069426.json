  "stimulus": "<p>Jean-Bernard Caron and colleagues recently discovered a cache of jellyfish fossils in the Burgess Shale, a site in the Canadian Rockies that is rich in fossils from the Cambrian period (over 500 million years ago). Caron and colleagues claim that these are the oldest jellyfish fossils ever discovered. In the past twenty years, two sites in China and the United States have yielded fossils of a similar age that some experts believe are most likely jellyfish due to their shapes and the appearance of projecting tentacles. But Caron and colleagues argue that the apparent tentacles are in fact the comb rows of ctenophores, gelatinous animals that are only distantly related to jellyfish.</p>",

  "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it presents a statement that, if true, would most directly weaken Caron and colleagues&rsquo; claim that the apparent tentacles in the Chinese and American fossils are actually ctenophore comb rows. If the fossils are so poorly preserved that they cannot be conclusively identified as either organism, neither the claim that they are jellyfish nor, as Caron claims, that they are ctenophores would be supported.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Caron&rsquo;s claim is that fossils from the US and China are ctenophores, not jellyfish. These fossils are said to be \"of a similar age\" to the Cambrian fossils found in the Canadian Rockies. And nothing in the text or this choice suggests that the presence or absence of ctenophores after the Cambrian would have any bearing on whether the Cambrian fossils from the US and China are ctenophores. Choice C is incorrect. Caron&rsquo;s claim is that fossils from the US and China are ctenophores, not jellyfish. Nothing in the text suggests that the presence or absence of ctenophores in the Burgess Shale (in Canada) would affect whether the fossils found in the US and China are ctenophores. Choice D is incorrect. Caron&rsquo;s claim is that fossils from the US and China are ctenophores, not jellyfish. Although fossil quality is a plausible issue for the research described in the text, nothing in the text or this choice suggests that the fossils from US and China would have been too poorly preserved for proper identification.</p>",
