  "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, \"consider\" most nearly means to take into account and follow. The text explains that Marija&rsquo;s job was to make sure that her sister&rsquo;s wedding proceeded in certain ways (\"in due form\") and that she loudly directed everyone&rsquo;s actions all day. The text then indicates that Marija was so focused on ensuring that others \"conformed to the proprieties\"&mdash;that is, that they behaved in appropriate ways&mdash;that she failed to \"consider them herself\"; that is, she didn&rsquo;t take standards of appropriate behavior into account and follow them in her own actions.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. In some contexts, \"consider\" can mean to think about something in a positive way&mdash;which can involve admiration&mdash;but the text doesn&rsquo;t suggest that Marija was so busy imposing \"proprieties\" (standards of appropriate behavior) on others that she didn&rsquo;t admire and praise them herself. The context suggests it&rsquo;s more likely that Marija did speak positively of \"due form\" and \"the best home traditions\" while ensuring others behaved in certain ways. Choice C is incorrect. In some contexts, \"consider\" can mean to come to a decision, but the text doesn&rsquo;t suggest that Marija wasn&rsquo;t able to make a decision for herself about the \"proprieties\" (standards of appropriate behavior) she ensured everyone else conformed to. Rather, the context conveys that Marija knew very clearly which behaviors others should follow as \"due form\" and \"the best home traditions.\" Choice D is incorrect. In some contexts, \"consider\" can mean to have an opinion, but the text doesn&rsquo;t suggest that Marija wasn&rsquo;t able to have an opinion on the \"proprieties\" (standards of appropriate behavior) she was ensuring others conformed to. Rather, the context conveys that Marija had strong feelings about which behaviors were \"due form\" and \"the best home traditions.\"</p>",
