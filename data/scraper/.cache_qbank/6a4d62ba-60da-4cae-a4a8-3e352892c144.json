  "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer because it directly applies the research findings described in Text 2 to the situation underlined in Text 1. The underlined sentence in Text 1 describes a common scenario in which two friends are deciding on a lunch location. Text 1 goes on to explain that people often don&rsquo;t reveal their true preferences in such situations, instead claiming they&rsquo;re fine with any option so that they can appear more easygoing and likable. Text 2 presents research that advises against this approach, stating that people who don&rsquo;t express their preferences aren&rsquo;t viewed as more likable and that this behavior actually makes decisions more difficult for others. Since Text 2 specifically argues against the strategy of concealing preferences and indicates negative outcomes from doing so, the author of Text 2 would most likely recommend stating a preference about where to eat.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because nothing in Text 2 suggests that canceling plans is a good solution. The author of Text 2 is addressing how to make joint decisions effectively (through stating your own preference), not advocating for avoiding such decisions entirely. Choice B is incorrect because asking where the friend typically likes to eat still avoids stating one&rsquo;s own preference. While this approach might seem considerate, it continues the pattern of not revealing true preferences that Text 2 identifies as problematic. Choice D is incorrect because changing the subject would avoid making any decision altogether, which contradicts the implied advice in Text 2. The author of Text 2 presents research suggesting that directly engaging with the decision by stating preferences helps others make decisions and makes you appear more likable.</p>",
