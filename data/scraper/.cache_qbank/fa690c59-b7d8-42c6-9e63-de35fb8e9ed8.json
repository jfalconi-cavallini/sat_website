  "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text&rsquo;s discussion of Hegel&rsquo;s works. In this context, \"opaque\" means difficult to understand or unclear. The text creates a contrast between the initial impression given by Hegel&rsquo;s works and their influence and insight, noting that readers must \"penetrate Hegel&rsquo;s frustratingly dense prose\" to access his important ideas. This context clearly establishes that Hegel&rsquo;s writing is initially challenging to comprehend, or opaque.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because \"authoritative\" means influential or clearly accurate. Hegel&rsquo;s works may be authoritative, but it wouldn&rsquo;t make logical sense in context to say that although his works seem authoritative, they have been influential. Instead, the text focuses on the fact that Hegel&rsquo;s works are challenging to read, but that working through the dense prose can be rewarding. Choice C is incorrect because referring to Hegel&rsquo;s works as \"empirical,\" which means factual or verifiable, would suggest that they are based on observation or experience rather than theory. The text, however, doesn&rsquo;t address this aspect of Hegel&rsquo;s philosophy. Instead, it focuses on the difficulty of understanding his writing. Choice D is incorrect because describing Hegel&rsquo;s works as \"facile,\" which means superficial or simplistic, would directly contradict the text&rsquo;s characterization of his writing as \"frustratingly dense\" and requiring effort to understand.</p>",
