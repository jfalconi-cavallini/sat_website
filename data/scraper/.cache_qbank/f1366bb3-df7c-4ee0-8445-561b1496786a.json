  "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text&rsquo;s discussion of the difficulty in naming a large number of minor planets. In this context, \"insurmountable\" means impossible to overcome or too difficult to solve. The text establishes that coming up with distinct names for minor planets is already a difficult task that has become even more challenging because there are now more than 500,000 known minor planets. The logical conclusion is that finding unique names for such a vast number of celestial objects has become virtually impossible&mdash;or insurmountable&mdash;which explains why the majority of recently discovered minor planets receive only identification numbers instead of proper names.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because \"feasible\" means possible to do or achieve, which would contradict the logic of the text. The text indicates that the task of naming minor planets has become more difficult because of their large number. The text then explains that this is why most new discoveries receive only identification numbers. If the task were feasible, there would be no reason to abandon the practice of giving proper names to minor planets in favor of using only numbers. Choice C is incorrect because \"substantial\" means considerable in size, amount, or importance. While the text does suggest that naming all minor planets would be a significant undertaking, describing the task as substantial wouldn&rsquo;t logically explain why the naming practice has been largely abandoned in favor of using only identification numbers. The text suggests that the task has become virtually impossible (insurmountable), not merely large or significant. Choice D is incorrect because \"unnecessary,\" which means not needed, would suggest that giving proper names to minor planets serves no purpose. However, the text doesn&rsquo;t question the value or purpose of naming minor planets; rather, it explains that the sheer number of discoveries has made the already challenging naming task nearly impossible to complete. The text provides an example of a named minor planet (1227 Geranium), indicating that naming has been considered worthwhile but has become impractical because of the volume.</p>",
