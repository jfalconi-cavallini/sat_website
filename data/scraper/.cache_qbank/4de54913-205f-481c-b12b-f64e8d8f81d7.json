  "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most directly support the museum administrators&rsquo; claim that concerns about virtual tours replacing in-person visits were unjustified. The text explains that after the Galleria dell&rsquo;Accademia began offering online tours, there were concerns that if people viewed these virtual tours, they would consider an in-person visit to be unnecessary. The finding that many visitors who were surveyed indicated that the virtual tours actually convinced them to plan an in-person visit directly contradicts these concerns. Rather than deterring in-person visits, virtual tours actively encouraged them, providing strong support for the administrators&rsquo; claim that the initial concerns were unfounded.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. The finding that most surveyed visitors were unaware of the virtual tours before their first in-person visit wouldn&rsquo;t directly address whether virtual tours affect decisions about in-person visits. This finding would only indicate that these particular visitors didn&rsquo;t have the opportunity to be influenced by virtual tours when making their decision to visit. Choice C is incorrect because the geographic location of visitors wouldn&rsquo;t address the impact of virtual tours on people&rsquo;s decisions to visit the museum in person. Whether visitors live in Florence or elsewhere would suggest nothing about whether virtual tours influenced their choice. This information is irrelevant to the administrators&rsquo; claim about the relationship between virtual tours and in-person visits. Choice D is incorrect because visitors&rsquo; intentions to view virtual tours after their in-person visit wouldn&rsquo;t address the initial concerns that virtual tours might make in-person visits seem unnecessary. This finding indicates that some visitors plan to use virtual tours as a way to remember their visit, but it provides no information about whether virtual tours influenced their decision to visit in person in the first place, which is what the administrators&rsquo; claim addresses.</p>",
