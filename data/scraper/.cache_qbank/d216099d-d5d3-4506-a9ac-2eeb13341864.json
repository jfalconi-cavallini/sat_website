  "stimulus": "<p>Catherine L. Cardel&uacute;s is a researcher who studies canopy soil. Canopy soil is formed in a tree&rsquo;s branches (its canopy) when dead leaves and other falling things collect. This material breaks down, becoming canopy soil. Canopy soil helps preserve a healthy water cycle (how water moves through the environment) in rainforests. This benefit is one reason Cardel&uacute;s is interested in the canopy soils in large choib&aacute; trees in rainforests in Costa Rica.</p>",

  "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately describes the overall structure of the text. The text begins by mentioning Catherine L. Cardel&uacute;s, \"a researcher who studies canopy soil.\" The text then provides information about her chosen research topic: the formation of canopy soil in tree branches, the role of canopy soil in preserving a healthy water cycle in rainforests, and Cardel&uacute;s&rsquo;s specific interest in \"the canopy soils in large choib&aacute; trees in rainforests in Costa Rica.\" Thus, the text introduces a researcher and then gives information about what she researches.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t mention any disagreement between researchers, nor does it describe how such a disagreement was resolved. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t present an idea that Cardel&uacute;s disagrees with; rather, it describes her research interests and the significance of canopy soil. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t compare the sizes of different types of trees over time. While the text mentions \"large choib&aacute; trees,\" it doesn&rsquo;t compare them to any other tree type or discuss changes in tree size over several years.</p>",
