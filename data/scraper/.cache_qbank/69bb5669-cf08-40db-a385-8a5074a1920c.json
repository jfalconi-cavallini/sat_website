  "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer. Noting that the evidence suggests Indigenous peoples may have found dinosaur remains in 1100 CE, the sentence emphasizes how the 1990 discovery challenged Plot&rsquo;s reputation as the first person to discover dinosaur remains.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. While the sentence does emphasize that Benoit challenged Plot&rsquo;s reputation, it\nmisrepresents information in the notes; Plot was reputed to be the first person to discover dinosaur remains in general, not the first person to discover <em>M. carinatus</em> remains specifically. Choice C is incorrect. The sentence only partially explains the significance of the 1990 discovery, noting that it suggests Indigenous people brought dinosaur remains to the cave in 1100 CE; it doesn&rsquo;t explain the discovery&rsquo;s significance to Plot&rsquo;s reputation. Choice D is incorrect. While the sentence does emphasize that the discovery challenged Plot&rsquo;s reputation, it misrepresents information in the notes. The notes don&rsquo;t indicate that the 1990 discovery cast any doubt on Plot&rsquo;s claims to have found fossilized dinosaur bones; rather, the discovery challenged Plot&rsquo;s reputation for being the first to discover dinosaur bones.</p>",
