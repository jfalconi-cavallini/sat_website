  "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the function of the underlined portion in the text. The underlined portion (\"which made me sad because that was the only thing Mago had envied me for\") directly expresses Grande&rsquo;s unhappiness about her sister&rsquo;s diminished interest in her Barbie doll. The underlined text specifically identifies that Grande feels sad and explains why Mago&rsquo;s disinterest particularly affects her&mdash;because it was the one rare instance where her older sister had envied her, rather than the reverse.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the underlined portion expresses sadness, not anger. Although there is some correspondence between the emotions anger and envy and the text does indicate that Grande usually envies her sister, the underlined portion states that Grande feels sad about Mago&rsquo;s disinterest in Grande&rsquo;s Barbie, not angry about Mago&rsquo;s refusal to spend time with her. Choice C is incorrect. While the first part of the sentence that contains the underlined portion indicates that Mago has previously taken an interest in Grande&rsquo;s Barbie, implying that the sisters may regularly have played with the Barbie together in the past, the underlined portion doesn&rsquo;t provide an example of this. The underlined portion instead explains why Mago&rsquo;s recently developed disinterest in the Barbie saddens Grande. Choice D is incorrect because neither the underlined portion nor the text as a whole explains why Mago is unwilling to play with Grande. Rather than addressing Mago&rsquo;s motivation or reasoning, the underlined portion describes Grande&rsquo;s emotional reaction to Mago&rsquo;s disinterest in Grande&rsquo;s Barbie and explains why this lack of interest matters to Grande.</p>",
