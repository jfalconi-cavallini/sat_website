  "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer. The convention being tested is subject-modifier placement. This choice makes the noun phrase \"findings from a 2022 study\" the subject of the sentence and places it immediately after the modifying phrase \"supported...Ages.\" In doing so, this choice clearly establishes that the findings&mdash;and not another noun in the sentence&mdash;are supported by the biochemical analyses.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it results in a dangling modifier. The placement of \"vegetables and grains\" immediately after the modifying phrase illogically suggests that vegetables and grains are supported by biochemical analyses. Choice B is incorrect because it results in a dangling modifier. The placement of \"early medieval rulers&rsquo; diets\" immediately after the modifying phrase illogically suggests that the rulers&rsquo; diets are supported by biochemical analyses. Choice C is incorrect because it results in a dangling modifier. The placement of \"the primary components\" immediately after the modifying phrase illogically suggests that the primary components are supported by biochemical analyses.</p>",
