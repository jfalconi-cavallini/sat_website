  "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer. The sentence makes and supports a generalization about exoplanets, noting that the names of exoplanets have diverse origins and supporting this with the examples of the origins of \"Phobetor\" and \"Mastika.\"</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The sentence misrepresents information from the notes, implying that there are multiple exoplanets with the same names. Additionally, the sentence provides no support for its generalization. Choice B is incorrect. The sentence contrasts the masses of two specific exoplanets; it doesn&rsquo;t make and support a generalization about exoplanets. Choice C is incorrect. The sentence makes and supports a generalization about stars, not exoplanets.</p>",
