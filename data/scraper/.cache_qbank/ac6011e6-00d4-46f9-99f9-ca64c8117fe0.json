The sentence compares the extinction risks of the two species, noting that <em>C. olivacea</em> has a higher risk of becoming extinct in the near future than <em>C. furcatus</em>.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. While the sentence does compare the extinction risks of the two species, it misrepresents information from the notes; <em>C. olivacea</em> faces a higher risk of becoming extinct in the near future than <em>C. furcatus</em>, not the other way around. Choice C is incorrect. While the sentence mentions that conservation organizations have evaluated both species for extinction risk, it doesn&rsquo;t compare the extinction risks of the two species. Choice D is incorrect. While the sentence states that <em>C. olivacea</em> faces a high risk of extinction, it doesn&rsquo;t mention <em>C. furcatus</em> or compare the extinction risks of the two species.</p>",
