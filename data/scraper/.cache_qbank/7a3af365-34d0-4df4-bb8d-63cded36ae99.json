  "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the table to complete the statement about copper mining. The table shows the amount of copper mined in each of four countries in 1995 and 2020. According to the text, a student who consults the table notes that the country that mined 0.55 million metric tons of copper in 2020 had mined a different amount in 1995. The table indicates that Kazakhstan is the country that mined 0.55 million metric tons of copper in 2020 and 0.26 million metric tons of copper in 1995.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it doesn&rsquo;t provide the amount of copper mined in 1995 by Kazakhstan, the country that mined 0.55 million metric tons of copper in 2020. According to the table, Canada mined 0.73 million metric tons of copper in 1995 and 0.59 million metric tons in 2020. It didn&rsquo;t mine 0.55 million metric tons in either year. Choice B is incorrect because it doesn&rsquo;t provide the amount of copper mined in 1995 by Kazakhstan, the country that mined 0.55 million metric tons of copper in 2020. According to the table, Indonesia mined 0.44 million metric tons of copper in 1995 and 0.51 million metric tons in 2020. It didn&rsquo;t mine 0.55 million metric tons in either year. Choice D is incorrect because it doesn&rsquo;t provide the amount of copper mined in 1995 by Kazakhstan, the country that mined 0.55 million metric tons of copper in 2020. According to the table, Chile mined 2.49 million metric tons of copper in 1995 and 5.73 million metric tons in 2020. It didn&rsquo;t mine 0.55 million metric tons in either year.</p>",
