Another factor is that the morphological variability of microorganisms is poorly understood compared to that of vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, and algae, creating uncertainty about how to evaluate microorganisms as species. Researchers’ decisions on such matters therefore can be highly consequential. Indeed, the two censuses reported similar counts of vertebrate, plant, and algal species, suggesting that ______ blank",Which choice most logically completes the text?,A. Coll and colleagues reported a much higher number of species than Bianchi and Morri did largely due to the inclusion of invertebrate species that had not been described at the time of Bianchi and Morri’s census. | B. some differences observed in microorganisms may have been treated as variations within species by Bianchi and Morri but treated as indicative of distinct species by Coll and colleagues. | C. Bianchi and Morri may have been less sensitive to the degree of morphological variation displayed within a typical species of microorganism than Coll and colleagues were. | D. the absence of clarity regarding how to differentiate among species of microorganisms may have resulted in Coll and colleagues underestimating the number of microorganism species.,B,"Choice B is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically completes the text’s discussion of the different counts of species in the Mediterranean Sea. The text states that Coll and colleagues reported almost double the number of species that Bianchi and Morri reported in their study ten years earlier. According to the text, this difference can only be partly attributed to new invertebrate species being described in the years between the two studies, which means there must be an additional factor that made Coll and colleagues’ count so much higher than Bianchi and Morri’s count. The text goes on to explain that factor: researchers have a relatively poor understanding of microorganisms’ morphological variability, or the differences in microorganisms’ structure and form. This poor understanding makes it hard to classify microorganisms by species and means that researchers’ decisions about classifying microorganisms can have a large effect on the overall species counts that researchers report. Additionally, the text says that the two censuses reported similar numbers of vertebrate, plant, and algal species, which means that the difference in overall species did not come from differences in those categories. Given all this information, it most logically follows that Coll and colleagues may have treated some of the differences among microorganisms as indicative of the microorganisms being different species, whereas Bianchi and Morri treated those differences as variations within species, resulting in Coll and colleagues reporting many more species than Bianchi and Morri did. Choice A is incorrect because the text explicitly addresses this issue by stating that the description of new invertebrate species in the years between the two studies can explain only part of the difference in the number of species reported by the studies. The focus of the text is on explaining the difference between Coll and colleagues’ count and Bianchi and Morri’s count that cannot be accounted for by the inclusion of invertebrate species that had not been described at the time of Bianchi and Morri’s study. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Bianchi and Morri may have been less sensitive to how much the form and structure of microorganisms vary within the same species than Coll and colleagues were. If Bianchi and Morri had been less sensitive to within-species variation than Coll and colleagues were, Bianchi and Morri would likely have reported more species than Coll and colleagues did, since less sensitivity to within-species variation would lead researchers to classify as different species microorganisms that more sensitive researchers would classify as variations within the same species. The text indicates, however, that Bianchi and Morri reported far fewer species than Coll and colleagues did; since the text also excludes other explanations for this difference, it suggests that in fact Bianchi and Morri were more sensitive to within-species variation than Coll and colleagues were, leading Bianchi and Morri to report fewer overall species. Choice D is incorrect because the text is focused on explaining why Coll and colleagues reported many more species than Bianchi and Morri did, and an underestimate of the number of microorganism species by Coll and colleagues would not explain that difference—it would suggest, in fact, that the difference in the number of species should have been even larger."

According to the text, conceptual artists Gins and Arakawa have designed an apartment building that is disorienting because of several unconventional elements, such as uneven kitchen counters and “a door to nowhere.” The text goes on to suggest that there may be benefits to this kind of design because filmmaker Yamaoka lived in the apartment building for four years and reported health benefits. Thus, although the design is impractical, it may improve the well-being of the apartment building’s residents. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text mentions that Yamaoka lived in the apartment for four years, it doesn’t address how long someone can beneficially live in a home surrounded by fanciful features or whether doing so can be sustained. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text mentions the potential benefits of living in a home with disorienting design features, it doesn’t suggest that this is the most effective method to create a physically stimulating environment.

The text begins by explaining that the perception of ""the time spent obtaining a gift…as a reflection of the gift’s thoughtfulness"" is a social norm of gift giving. The text then explains that although those who receive digital gift cards view them as easier to use than physical gift cards, a marketing study nonetheless showed that 94.8% of participants found physical gift cards more ""socially acceptable"" to give. The text specifically contrasts the ease with which digital gift cards ""can be purchased online from anywhere"" with the fact that physical gift cards ""sometimes must be purchased in person""—suggesting the greater difficulty of obtaining physical cards. Given the text’s initial premise that gift-giving norms equate the thoughtfulness of a gift with the effort involved in acquiring that gift, it is reasonable to infer that people perceive digital gift cards as requiring less effort to obtain and thus assume recipients will appreciate them less, even though recipients actually prefer gift cards in the more usable digital format. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text does discuss recipients’ preference of digital versus physical gift cards and the relative ease with which the two formats can be used, it doesn’t consider the misconceptions that gift givers may have of these factors. Moreover, the text establishes that recipients regard digital gift cards as easier to use and therefore preferable to physical gift cards. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t consider whether recipients of gift cards feel a sense of ownership toward them, nor does the text touch on the greater tangibility of physical versus digital gift cards. Instead, the text contrasts the two formats of gift cards in terms of their respective usability and the difficulty involved in acquiring them and discusses how those factors influence people’s perceptions of the two formats. Choice C is incorrect because it contradicts the text, which explains that recipients regard digital gift cards as superior to physical ones because they are easier to use than physical cards, not because physical gift cards require greater effort to obtain than digital gift cards do. Moreover, the text doesn’t characterize the effort required to obtain physical gift cards as ""unnecessary."""

Choice C is incorrect. Caron’s claim is that fossils from the US and China are ctenophores, not jellyfish. Nothing in the text suggests that the presence or absence of ctenophores in the Burgess Shale (in Canada) would affect whether the fossils found in the US and China are ctenophores. Choice D is incorrect. Caron’s claim is that fossils from the US and China are ctenophores, not jellyfish. Although fossil quality is a plausible issue for the research described in the text, nothing in the text or this choice suggests that the fossils from US and China would have been too poorly preserved for proper identification."

Elinor lives with her younger sisters and her mother, Mrs. Dashwood. Elinor, this eldest daughter, whose advice was so effectual, possessed a strength of understanding, and coolness of judgment, which qualified her, though only nineteen, to be the counsellor of her mother, and enabled her frequently to counteract, to the advantage of them all, that eagerness of mind in Mrs. Dashwood which must generally have led to imprudence. She had an excellent heart;—her disposition was affectionate, and her feelings were strong; but she knew how to govern them: it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn; and which one of her sisters had resolved never to be taught.","According to the text, what is true about Elinor?",A.

The text indicates that although Elinor is “only nineteen,” she gives good advice and exhibits such a high level of understanding and judgment that she serves as “the counsellor of her mother.” Thus, Elinor is mature beyond her years. Choice A is incorrect because it isn’t supported by the text: although the text says that Elinor advises her mother and often counteracts her mother’s impulses, there’s no mention of Elinor arguing with her mother or failing to change her mother’s mind. Choice B is incorrect because it isn’t supported by the text: although the text mentions that Elinor has strong feelings, it doesn’t indicate that she’s excessively sensitive when it comes to family issues. Choice C is incorrect because it isn’t supported by the text: there’s no mention of what Elinor thinks about her mother and no suggestion that she thinks her mother is a bad role model. Because she’s described as having “an excellent heart,” Elinor likely doesn’t think ill of her mother."

Mimesis is typically translated as “imitation” in modern editions of ancient Greek texts, but scholar Stephen Halliwell warns that this is overly reductive: “imitation” implies that art merely copies—and is thus by definition entirely derivative of—a reality that exists outside and prior to the work of art, and translating “mimesis” thusly obscures the multifaceted ways in which the ancient Greeks understood the relationship between art and reality.","Which statement, if true, would most directly support the claim by Halliwell presented in the text?","A.

If Plato’s works tend to treat representational art as an inferior or inadequate reflection of the physical world (consistent with the idea of mere imitation), while Aristotle’s works suggest that the term ""mimesis"" can refer to art’s ability to show conditions that don’t currently exist but could exist (going beyond imitation into novel creation), that evidence would support the claim that the term ""mimesis"" means more than just ""imitation"" and that ancient Greek philosophers held different views of the relationship between art and reality. Choice A is incorrect because information about the root word mimos first being used in drama and the root mim - coming to be associated with music and poetry wouldn’t indicate anything about the meaning of the specific term ""mimesis"" as it was used by ancient Greek philosophers in discussions of representational art; thus, the information would have no bearing on Halliwell’s claim that a common translation of the specific term is an oversimplification. Choice B is incorrect because the issue of art’s psychological effects on audiences gets at how people respond to works of art instead of how art itself is related to reality, so the idea that Plato and Aristotle both addressed such effects in their considerations of mimesis wouldn’t have any bearing on Halliwell’s claim that a common translation of that term oversimplifies the relationship between art and reality. Further, this idea would touch on one general similarity in approaches to mimesis instead of illustrating the multifaceted, or varied, ways Halliwell claims ancient Greek philosophers understood art’s relation to reality. Choice C is incorrect because the idea that Plato discussed aesthetics in his early works but didn’t use the term ""mimesis"" until later doesn’t give any indication of how Plato or any other ancient Greek philosophers understood the relation between art and reality, so it would have no bearing on Halliwell’s claim that a common translation of the term ""mimesis"" is oversimplified and fails to reflect the varied ways the philosophers understood that relationship."

The graph shows characteristics of the banks of the Provo River downstream of the Jordanelle Dam in three different years—1987, 1993, and 2006. Specifically, the graph shows the amount of grass cover, bare soil, and forest cover in those years. The text indicates that the Jordanelle Dam was built in 1992, meaning that the data from the graph for 1987 reflect conditions before the dam was built, whereas the data for 1993 and 2006 reflect conditions after the dam was built. The data show that grass cover increased substantially from 1987 to 1993 and again from 1993 to 2006. The data also show that forest cover declined over those periods. Together, these data support Martinez and colleagues’ conclusion that the dam was beneficial for grass plants but not for trees—grass cover increased significantly after the dam was built, while forest cover declined. Choice A is incorrect. Although it is true that, in the graph, the lowest value for grass cover is approximately 58,000 square meters and the highest value for forest cover is approximately 75,000 square meters, both values are from 1987, before the Jordanelle Dam was built in 1992. Therefore, this information alone cannot support Martinez and colleagues’ conclusion about changes in grass and tree cover following the construction of the dam. Choice B is incorrect because it presents an inaccurate description of data from the graph. The graph shows that there was more forest cover than grass cover in 1987, not that there was more grass cover than forest cover that year. Choice C is incorrect because, while it accurately reflects data from the graph when it compares grass cover and forest cover to bare soil, these data alone cannot support Martinez and colleagues’ conclusion that the dam led to changes that benefited grass plants but not trees. An increase in grass cover relative to bare soil following the construction of the dam might indicate that the dam benefited grass plants, but the fact that there was more forest cover than bare soil in all three years doesn’t indicate that the dam failed to benefit trees."

Then, the text presents the results of a research study examining the effect of limited logging practices on specific forest plots, finding that the plots with limited logging may be ""more robust"" (healthier) than the plots that hadn’t been logged at all. Given these results, it follows that logging may be a useful practice for maintaining healthy forests if it is practiced in a limited way. Choice B is incorrect because the study referenced in the text only provides information on limited logging as a potential forest management strategy. There is no information in the text about how other forest management strategies support forest conservation efforts. Therefore, the text does not support the assertion that other forest management strategies are more successful than limited logging. Choice C is incorrect because the text presents a research study with findings that specific plots of forest with limited logging may be more robust than the forest plots that were not logged. Rather than suggesting that it is hard to know whether limited logging might be beneficial, the text suggests that the practice could be useful in forest conservation efforts. Choice D is incorrect. The text discusses the results of a research study that compares the health of forest plots with limited logging to forest plots that were not logged. It does not take a position on the best way to support forest health but rather presents a research study with findings that question conventionally held thoughts regarding the practice of logging."

In a 2020 study, Allen Kim, Charuta Pethe, and Steven Skiena claim that an observable pattern in such references reflects a shift in human behavior prompted by the spread of electric lighting in the late nineteenth century. The researchers drew this conclusion from an analysis of more than 50,000 novels spanning many centuries and cultures, using software to recognize and tally both specific time references—that is, clock phrases, such as 7 a.m. or 2:30 p.m. —and implied ones, such as mentions of meals typically associated with a particular time of day.","Which finding from the study, if true, would most directly support the researchers’ conclusion?","A. Novels published after the year 1800 include the clock phrase 10 a.m. less often than novels published before the year 1800 do. | B. Novels published after 1880 contain significantly more references to activities occurring after 10 p.m. than do novels from earlier periods. | C. Among novels published in the nineteenth century, implied time references become steadily more common than clock phrases as publication dates approach 1900. | D. The time references of noon (12 p.m. ) and midnight (12 a.m. ) are used with roughly the same frequency in the novels.",B,"Choice B is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most directly support the researchers’ conclusion that an observable pattern in time references in novels reflects a shift in human behavior prompted by the spread of electric lighting in the late nineteenth century. If novels published after 1880 contain significantly more references to activities occurring after 10 p.m. than novels from earlier periods do, this would suggest a change in human behavior and daily routines enabled by the availability of electric lighting. Before electric lighting—which provided illumination more easily than other available forms of light—many activities ceased after nightfall, so references to late-night activities would be less common in earlier novels. An increase in such references after 1880 would align with the researchers’ conclusion, reflecting an increase in late-night activities made possible by electric lighting. Choice A is incorrect because a decrease in references to 10 a.m. after the year 1800 would not support the researchers’ conclusion involving a shift in human behavior prompted by the spread of electric lighting toward the end of the 1800s. The time of 10 a.m. is in the morning and, in most places, characterized by daylight, so a change in references to that time would not be clearly linked to the impact of electric lighting. Choice C is incorrect because while an increase in implied time references relative to clock phrases in nineteenth-century novels could suggest a change in writing style or conventions, it does not directly support the conclusion involving a shift in human behavior prompted by the spread of electric lighting. The text indicates that the researchers’ conclusion is based on the content of the time references themselves, not the phrasing used. Choice D is incorrect. If references to noon and midnight are used with roughly the same frequency in all the novels analyzed by the researchers, this would reflect a lack of change in human behavior with regard to time and therefore would not support the researchers’ conclusion involving a shift in human behavior that occurred in response to the spread of electric lighting."

The text states that New gained new customers and that sewing machines allowed him to make bags more efficiently, or in less time than he could when sewing by hand. It’s reasonable to conclude that if New hadn’t reduced the time it took to make each bag by starting to use sewing machines, it would have been hard for him to keep up with the increased demand. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that New added unique, handcrafted details to his bags before he started using sewing machines and continued to do so after he started using them. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that individually designing each bag would have been a consequence of not using sewing machines, since New was already designing unique details for each bag before he started using sewing machines and continued to do so after he started using them.

According to the table, Colobanthus quitensis increased the area it covered by 55% from 2009 to 2018, whereas Deschampsia antarctica increased the area it covered by 28% during the same period. It therefore follows that Colobanthus quitensis saw a greater expansion than Deschampsia antarctica did and that Colobanthus quitensis increased the area of land it covered by more than half. Choice A is incorrect because according to the table, Deschampsia antarctica covered 1,230 square meters of land in 2009 and 1,576 square meters of land in 2018. Deschampsia antarctica therefore covered a larger, not a smaller, area of land in 2018 than in 2009.

In an experiment, the researchers placed two midge traps in a túngara frog breeding area.

The text begins by stating that the mating call of the male túngara frogs also attracts frog-biting midges, which prey on the frogs’ blood. Researchers Bernal and de Silva were curious if the mating calls were sufficient signals for the midges to locate the frogs or if midges also used carbon dioxide emitted by the frogs to locate their prey. The text then details the procedure the researchers used to investigate their question and summarizes their conclusion—that carbon dioxide does not serve as an additional cue to the midges. Thus, if more midges were found in the researchers’ trap that only played calls than in the trap that played calls and released carbon dioxide, it follows that the frog calls seem sufficient without the carbon dioxide cue. This finding supports the researchers’ conclusion that carbon dioxide does not serve as an additional cue to frog-biting midges. Choice A is incorrect because finding that the majority of frog-biting midges were found in the traps that both played the mating call and released carbon dioxide would present evidence that directly refutes the researchers’ conclusion—that carbon dioxide does not serve as an additional cue to the frog-biting midges regarding the location of túngara frogs. Choice B is incorrect because if the midges entered the trap that played calls and released carbon dioxide only during or immediately after carbon dioxide was released, that would suggest that the midges used the carbon dioxide as a way to locate their prey, a finding that would contradict the researchers’ conclusion that carbon dioxide was not an additional cue to the midges.

Although the quotation presents an image of an element of nature—the moon—it doesn’t mention a body of water; moreover, it portrays the moon not as an active participant in a scene but instead as static or unchanging (“ever and always the same”)."

The graph shows that at 20°C, the gap between the two bars showing ripening times for ethylene-treated bananas and untreated bananas crosses fewer than 2 gridlines (from about 4 days for ethylene-treated bananas to about 5.5 days for untreated bananas). Meanwhile, the graph shows that at 14°C, 16°C, and 18°C, the gap between the bars crosses more than 2 gridlines (from about 8 days for treated bananas to about 11 days for untreated bananas at 14°C; from about 6 days for treated bananas to about 9.5 days for untreated bananas at 16°C; and from about 5.5 days for treated bananas to about 8.5 days for untreated bananas at 18°C). Since the gap between the bars at each of these temperatures crosses more than 2 gridlines, and since each of these gaps is larger than the gap between the bars at 20°C, it can be concluded that ethylene was associated with a greater absolute change in ripening time at 14°C, 16°C, and 18°C than at 20°C. Choice A is incorrect because the graph shows that ethylene-treated bananas stored at 20°C ripen more quickly than ethylene-treated bananas stored at the other temperatures do (about 4 days at 20°C vs. about 5.5, 6, and 8 days at 18°C, 16°C, and 14°C, respectively) and that untreated bananas stored at 20°C ripen more quickly than untreated bananas stored at the other temperatures do (about 5.5 days at 20°C vs. about 8.5, 9.5, and 11 days at 18°C, 16°C, and 14°C, respectively). The information in the graph therefore indicates that storing bananas at 20°C speeds up ripening time relative to storing bananas at the other temperatures shown, not that this storage temperature slows ripening time. Choice B is incorrect because the graph shows that as temperature increases, the ripening time of untreated bananas decreases, from about 11 days at 14°C to about 5.5 days at 20°C, with no exceptions to this trend. The graph therefore shows that differences in temperature were associated with absolute differences in ripening time, not that there was no association between differences in temperature and differences in ripening time. Choice C is incorrect because the graph shows that ripening times of ethylene-treated bananas at 14°C and 16°C were about 8 and 6 days, respectively, which is greater than, not less than, ripening times of ethylene-treated bananas at 18°C and 20°C, which were about 5.5 and 4 days, respectively. In other words, bananas treated with ethylene ripen more slowly, not faster, at 14°C and 16°C than at 18°C and 20°C."

Heidi is initially frightened by an image in one of Grandmama’s books but quickly comes to appreciate its beauty. | D. Heidi is inspecting an image in one of Grandmama’s books because she has never seen a shepherd with his sheep before.,B,"Choice B is the best answer because it most effectively states the main idea of the text, which is that Heidi is delighted and fascinated by an image she sees in one of Grandmama’s books. In the text, Heidi screams upon first seeing the picture of the green pasture. In another context, such a reaction might suggest fear, but here the reaction is followed by descriptions of an image that’s peaceful rather than scary. The text goes on to describe Heidi’s eyes as “glowing” and states that she “devoured the scene,” suggesting that the image delights and fascinates her so much that she wants to examine every detail. Together, these descriptions suggest that Heidi is thrilled and intrigued by the image in the book. Choice A is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that Heidi is upset before seeing the peaceful image of the green pasture. Before Heidi sees that image, the text describes her as “looking with wondering eyes at the splendid pictures” in the book, suggesting that Heidi is intrigued, not that she’s unhappy. Choice C is incorrect. Although Heidi screams upon first seeing the image, the text’s description of the image and Heidi’s other reactions to it suggest that she is screaming with delight, not fear. The text describes the images in the book as “splendid” and the particular image that causes her to scream as peaceful rather than frightening. It also describes Heidi’s eyes as “glowing” and states that she “devoured the scene,” suggesting that the image of the green pasture delights and fascinates her so much that she wants to examine every detail.

According to the text, Shakespeare’s tragedies address broad themes that continue to appeal to today’s audiences. Indeed, the text suggests that these themes are timeless, as illustrated by the example of Romeo and Juliet , which the text states is still read and widely performed despite being set in the Italy of Shakespeare’s time. In contrast, the text indicates that audiences and readers may need to be familiar with several centuries of English history in order to understand Shakespeare’s history plays. Because many theatergoers and readers are unlikely to possess such extensive historical knowledge, it follows that they are likely to find Shakespeare’s history plays less engaging than his more accessible tragedies. Choice B is incorrect because the text never introduces a comparison between Shakespeare’s tragedies and twentieth-century plays, only between Shakespeare’s tragedies and his history plays. Since twentieth-century plays aren’t mentioned, there’s no basis in the text for the idea that some of Shakespeare’s tragedies are more relevant than twentieth-century plays to today’s audiences. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text indicates that Romeo and Juliet is thematically accessible to today’s audiences, it doesn’t suggest that Romeo and Juliet is more accessible than Shakespeare’s other tragedies. Rather, the text presents Romeo and Juliet as an example to support the idea that Shakespeare’s tragedies hold continued appeal for today’s readers and theatergoers. Choice D is incorrect. Although experts in English history would likely possess the knowledge needed to understand Shakespeare’s history plays, the text never mentions such experts or suggests that they would enjoy the history plays more than Shakespeare’s other works."

Before the 2006 study, estimates of the average velocity were low enough for the LMC to maintain an orbit around the Milky Way galaxy, but according to an analysis by Gurtina Besla and colleagues, the estimated velocity from the 2006 study is too high for the LMC to maintain such an orbit.

The text indicates that before 2006, all the estimated velocities of the LMC were within the range necessary to maintain orbit around the Milky Way galaxy. It then indicates that, according to Besla and colleagues, the 2006 estimate of 378 km/s is too high to maintain that orbit. This strongly implies that if the 1980 value (344 km/s) is below the orbital threshold, and if Besla and colleagues are correct that the 2006 value (378 km/s) is above that threshold, the maximum orbital velocity for the LMC must be somewhere in the range from above 344 km/s to below 378 km/s. Choice B is incorrect. The text indicates that the 2006 velocity estimate for the LMC (378 km/s) was the first estimate that exceeded the velocity needed to maintain orbit around the Milky Way. Thus, the 1980 estimate of 344 km/s and the 1994 estimate of 297 km/s must both be below the maximum possible orbital velocity for the LMC. Choice C is incorrect. The text states that Besla and colleagues’ analysis found that the velocity from the 2006 study (378 km/s) was too high for the LMC to maintain orbit around the Milky Way. Therefore, if a velocity of 378 km/s is too high, an even higher velocity will also be too high. Choice D is incorrect. The text indicates that the 2006 velocity estimate for the LMC (378 km/s) was the first to exceed the velocity range required to maintain orbit around the Milky Way. Thus, the 1994 estimate of 297 km/s must be below the maximum possible orbital velocity for the LMC."

Several mosasaur fossils have been found in regions known to be near the poles during the Late Cretaceous, while relatively few fossils of nonendothermic marine reptiles have been found in those locations. | D. During the Late Cretaceous, seawater temperatures were likely higher throughout mosasaurs’ range, including near the poles, than seawater temperatures at those same latitudes are today.",C,"Choice C is the best answer because it presents the finding that, if true, would best support Suarez, Pérez-Huerta, and Harrell’s claim about mosasaurs. The text states that Suarez, Pérez-Huerta, and Harrell’s research on mosasaur tooth enamel led them to conclude that mosasaurs were endothermic, which means that they could live in waters at many different temperatures and still maintain a stable body temperature. The researchers claim that endothermy enabled mosasaurs to live in relatively cold waters near the poles. If several mosasaur fossils have been found in areas that were near the poles during the period when mosasaurs were alive and fossils of nonendothermic marine reptiles are rare in such locations, that would support the researchers’ claim: it would show that mosasaurs inhabited polar waters but nonendothermic marine mammals tended not to, suggesting that endothermy may have been the characteristic that enabled mosasaurs to include polar waters in their range. Choice A is incorrect because finding that it’s easier to determine mosasaur body temperatures from tooth enamel data than it is to determine nonendothermic reptile body temperatures wouldn’t support the researchers’ claim. Whether one research process is more difficult than another indicates nothing about the results of those processes and therefore is irrelevant to the issue of where mosasaurs lived and what enabled them to live in those locations. Choice B is incorrect because finding roughly equal numbers of mosasaur and nonendothermic marine reptile fossils in areas that were near the poles in the Late Cretaceous would suggest that endothermy didn’t give mosasaurs any particular advantage when it came to expanding their range to include relatively cold polar waters, thereby weakening the researchers’ claim rather than supporting it. Choice D is incorrect because finding that the temperature of seawater in the Late Cretaceous was warmer than seawater today wouldn’t weaken the researchers’ claim. Seawater in the Late Cretaceous could have been warmer than seawater today but still cold enough for endothermy to be advantageous to mosasaurs, so this finding wouldn’t provide enough information to either support or weaken the researchers’ claim."

The text begins by explaining where and how the plural pronoun ""y’all"" originated and then goes on to state that its use has been rising in popularity, even in areas outside of its place of origin. The text then attributes this rise in popularity to the fact that many varieties of English do not have a pronoun to address more than one person, and thus ""you"" must function as both a singular and plural pronoun.

The quotation explains that to create the work, Catlett combined Indigenous sculpture with the visual aesthetic of modern muralists from Mexico as well as that of German artist Kathe Kollwitz. In other words, Catlett was able to unify several artistic traditions and styles within a single sculpture. Choice B is incorrect because in discussing the technique and subject matter of Catlett’s collage, the quotation makes no reference to particular traditions or styles. Choice C is incorrect because in describing the sculpture, the quotation doesn’t mention any artistic traditions or styles that Catlett may have synthesized to create the work.

The text establishes that M. boolii only grows naturally in the state of Sonora in Mexico, which makes it particularly vulnerable to extinction. The text then contrasts two approaches to conservation: the traditional single-species approach that individually focuses on at-risk species and a newer ecosystem-based approach that considers the interactions between climate, terrain, and various species in a geographical area. According to the text, conservationists have recently argued that this ecosystem-based approach may lead to better outcomes for all species in a location. If this ecosystem view is correct, then the single-species approach to conserving M. boolii would likely fail to consider how the cactus’s survival depends on its interactions with other species in Sonora’s ecosystem. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t address the distribution of Mammillaria species besides M. boolii throughout Mexico or discuss how that distribution affects survival. The text focuses specifically on M. boolii in Sonora and different approaches to its conservation. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that climatic changes in Sonora would reduce competition for M. boolii or that conservation efforts are focused on understanding this specific dynamic. In fact, the text implies that an ecosystem-based approach would consider climate among many other factors but doesn’t specify how climatic changes might affect competition between species. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that the single-species approach would shift the focus of conservation efforts away from M. boolii itself—rather, it suggests that this approach might be too narrowly focused on M. boolii alone without considering the broader ecosystem-related factors that affect its survival."

The text of the poem as published in the quarterly journal is not identical to the text of the poem published in the stand-alone volume. | B. Many critics believe that the poet’s explanatory notes remove certain ambiguities of the poem and make it less interesting as a result. | C. The publishers of the stand-alone volume requested the explanatory notes from the poet in order to make the book attractive to readers who already had a copy of the poem in a journal issue. | D. Correspondence between the poet and the publisher reveals that the poet’s explanatory notes went through several drafts.,C,"Choice C is the best answer because it would most directly support the student’s claim about the motivation for including explanatory notes with the stand-alone volume of the poem. The text explains that the poem had previously been published without the notes in a quarterly journal. It stands to reason that readers who had purchased the journal issue containing the poem would be unlikely to purchase an unchanged version of the poem in a stand-alone volume. However, the inclusion of notes in that volume would encourage the purchase of a stand-alone volume, since the later text would differ from the original by including the author’s own explanation of the poem. Therefore, if it were true that the publishers of the stand-alone volume had requested the notes to make the book attractive to readers who already had a copy of the journal issue, this fact would support the student’s claim that the notes were included primarily as a marketing device. Choice A is incorrect because the student’s claim is about the motivation for including the explanatory notes in the stand-alone volume, not about changes that might have been made to the poem itself for publication in that volume; moreover, the text never suggests that such changes were made. Choice B is incorrect because the student’s claim is about why the explanatory notes were included in the stand-alone volume, not about how the notes affected readers’ and critics’ subsequent experience of the poem. Choice D is incorrect because the fact that the poet drafted multiple versions of the explanatory notes doesn’t directly address the issue of whether the notes were intended as a marketing device, as the student claims; the correspondence would support this claim only if it showed that the poet had revised the notes specifically to make them useful to the marketing of the stand-alone volume."

Researchers have identified an innovative new method for working with unusual crystalline structures. | C. Graphene is the most important of the components required to capture an image of a Wigner crystal. | D. It’s difficult to acquire an image of a Wigner crystal because of the crystal’s honeycomb structure.,A,"Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. According to the text, Eugene Wigner hypothesized that a crystal could exist that would be composed of electrons and have a honeycomb-like shape. The text goes on to say that the existence of the Wigner crystal remained unconfirmed until Feng Wang and colleagues were able to make an impression of one using two semiconductors and an ultrathin sheet of graphene. Thus, the main idea is that researchers have obtained the most definitive evidence to date of the existence of the Wigner crystal. Choice B is incorrect because the text focuses on one kind of crystal—the Wigner crystal— and doesn’t discuss crystalline structures in general. And although the text conveys that Wang and colleagues figured out a way to capture an image of a Wigner crystal, it doesn’t address the idea of applying this approach to other types of crystals. Choice C is incorrect because the text describes in general the process Wang and colleagues followed to obtain an impression of the Wigner crystal; it doesn’t address the relative importance of each component in that process. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t state that researchers had a hard time getting an impression of the Wigner crystal because of its honeycomb structure. Nothing in the text indicates why it took so long to prove the existence of this crystal or take an impression of it."

This quotation states that the country meant a great deal to Alexandra and then goes on to detail several ways in which her natural surroundings affect her emotionally: the insects sound like “the sweetest music,” she feels as though “her heart were hiding” in the grass “with the quail and the plover,” and near the ridges she feels “the future stirring.” Choice B is incorrect because the quotation doesn’t suggest that Alexandra had a deep emotional connection to her natural surroundings but instead describes how she interacts with the people around her to learn more about crops, poultry, and experiments with clover hay. Choice C is incorrect because the quotation doesn’t suggest that Alexandra has a deep emotional connection to her natural surroundings but instead describes her nighttime departure in a wagon.

According to the text, some Euro-American farmers were using these techniques in the early nineteenth century despite few of the farmers having seen Haudenosaunee farms. One explanation for these facts might be that the farmers developed techniques on their own that already had been invented centuries earlier by the Haudenosaunee people, but the text explicitly bars, or rules out, this explanation. If Euro-American farmers didn’t learn these techniques from direct observation of Haudenosaunee practices and didn’t invent the techniques independently, then the most logical explanation is that they learned the techniques from other people who were more directly influenced by Haudenosaunee practices than the farmers themselves were. Once they learned about Haudenosaunee agricultural practices, Euro-American farmers could then apply those practices to their own farming. Choice B is incorrect because the fact that some Euro-American farmers in the northeastern United States were using Haudenosaunee techniques suggests that the techniques were likely useful for the crops the farmers raised, not that the crops typically cultivated by the farmers were not well suited to Haudenosaunee farming techniques. If the farmers’ crops were ill suited to the techniques, it’s unlikely that the farmers would have used those techniques. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates only that Haudenosaunee agricultural techniques were used by Euro-American farmers in the northeastern United States, not that these techniques were widely used outside this region. Choice D is incorrect because the text states that some Euro-American farmers were using Haudenosaunee farming techniques early in the nineteenth century.

If participants who saw a panel of three commentators with various views about an issue answered more questions about the issue correctly than did participants who saw a debate, that would support Tannen’s hypothesis since it would show that participants who heard multiple varied perspectives were better informed than were participants who heard a debate between opposing viewpoints. Choice A is incorrect because finding that participants perceived commentators in the debate as more knowledgeable than commentators in the panel is irrelevant to Tannen’s hypothesis, which is that presenting multiple perspectives on an issue is more informative to the audience than presenting opposing views of the issue is.

The text indicates that a common belief in business is that interruptions to working employees decrease energy and productivity levels. However, the text goes on to explain that a research team led by Harshad Puranik has found that there could be a social benefit to these interruptions. Since the team found that workplace interruptions can increase employees’ sense of belonging and job satisfaction, it follows that the interpersonal benefits of some interruptions can offset the perceived negative effects. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text presents research findings that suggest some workplace interruptions can have a positive effect on employee job satisfaction, no further information is presented to suggest at what frequency these interruptions are ideal. Furthermore, the text doesn’t tie workplace interruptions to increased productivity, but rather links it to social benefits such as sense of belonging. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t address employees’ motives for choosing not to interrupt their colleagues. The text presents research findings that suggest that there are some positive interpersonal effects of workplace interruptions that can increase employee job satisfaction.

The fact that Henry VIII commissioned a survey of church holdings just before enacting the Dissolution of the Monasteries suggests that he was interested in the potential profits from claiming their assets. This supports the historians’ assertion. Choice A is incorrect. This choice describes a potential effect of the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The decrease in the proportion of monks in England isn’t relevant to the question of Henry VIII’s motivations. Choice B is incorrect. Details about how the monks were treated during the dissolution don’t address Henry VIII’s motivations for enacting the policy in the first place. That the monks could keep the content of their cells (their rooms) and sell off the timber they’d harvested has no impact on the value of the monasteries’ estates—their land holdings.

The text explains that Neanderthals used clamshells to make tools and that the sturdiest, and therefore the most desirable, shells for this purpose are found on the seafloor, not on the beach. However, the researchers also concluded that the clamshell tools made from shells from the seafloor are rarer than those made from shells from the beach. Meanwhile the table shows that at each depth, the number of tools made from shells from the beach exceeds the number made from the more desirable shells from the seafloor. The fact that the more desirable shells are less common suggests that it was significantly more difficult to harvest shells from the seafloor than from the beach. Choice B is incorrect because knowing which depth represents the period of time with the highest Neanderthal population does not help answer the question of why the Neanderthals consistently made more tools from the less desirable shells from the beach than they made from the more desirable shells from the seafloor. Choice C is incorrect because it claims that the beach shells are more durable than the seafloor shells, which contradicts the text’s description of shells from the seafloor as smoother and sturdier than shells from the beach. Choice D is incorrect because knowing which depth has the most artifacts or whether the clam population fluctuated does not help explain why tools made from the less desirable shells from the beach outnumber tools made from the more desirable shells from the seafloor."

If REM sleep were homeostatically regulated in fur seals, then all the seals would compensate with REM levels significantly over baseline after going weeks without REM. We’d also expect the seals to maintain those elevated REM levels for some time. Since seals B and C return very quickly to baseline REM levels, this suggests that REM sleep in fur seals may not be regulated homeostatically. Choice A is incorrect. This doesn’t support the conclusion. If REM sleep were homeostatically regulated in fur seals, then we’d suspect the seals to sustain REM levels well above baseline for a prolonged period in order to compensate for weeks of REM deprivation while in the water.

The text explains that using the IWCI, an index on which higher scores indicate higher community integrity, researchers found that bulkheads are more strongly negatively correlated with waterbird community integrity than riprap is—that is, that bulkheads reduce the integrity of waterbird communities more than riprap does. The finding that waterbird communities at a site with a relatively high percentage of bulkheads along the shoreline (Old Road) had lower average IWCI scores than waterbird communities at a site with a relatively high percentage of riprap along the shoreline (Miles) did would illustrate the researchers’ finding, since it would be an example of lower waterbird community integrity in a location with substantial bulkhead presence than in a location with substantial riprap presence. Choice A is incorrect because a finding of similar waterbird community integrity in two sites predominated by bulkheads wouldn’t reveal anything about waterbird community integrity at sites predominated by riprap or how waterbird community integrity compares between the two types of sites.

Choice C is incorrect because it presents a finding that compares waterbird community integrity at sites with different overall amounts of shoreline hardening but without distinguishing between bulkheads and riprap. Such a distinction would be necessary to illustrate the researchers’ finding of a difference in how bulkheads and riprap each correlate with waterbird community integrity.

The text indicates that “until recently,” superfluorescence (intense, synchronized bursts of light emitted by dipoles) has solely been observed at very cold temperatures. However, it also states that, recently, Biliroglu and colleagues report observing the phenomenon at room temperature. They achieved this using “thin films made of perovskite and other similarly crystalline materials,” which the researchers claim allows for the formation of polarons.

Polynesian sweet potato varieties likely descend from a single South American variety that was domesticated, not wild.",C,"Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the sweet potato in Polynesia. The text indicates that the sweet potato is found in Polynesia but originated in South America, and that the sweet potato was being cultivated by Native Hawaiians and other Indigenous peoples in Polynesia long before sea voyages between South America and Polynesia began. The text goes on to note that research by Muñoz-Rodríguez and colleagues has established that the Polynesian varieties of sweet potato split from South American varieties more than 100,000 years ago, which is thousands of years before humans settled in Polynesia. If Polynesian peoples were cultivating the sweet potato before sea voyages between Polynesia and South America began, and if Polynesian varieties of sweet potato diverged from South American varieties well before people were in Polynesia, it can reasonably be concluded that humans didn’t play a role in bringing the sweet potato to Polynesia. Choice A is incorrect. The text doesn’t provide any information about when the sweet potato began to be cultivated in South America, so there’s no support for the conclusion that cultivation began in Polynesia before it began in South America. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that the sweet potato was being cultivated in Polynesia long before sea journeys between Polynesia and South America began. Therefore, it wouldn’t be reasonable to conclude that Polynesian peoples acquired the sweet potato from South American peoples. Additionally, the text indicates that the Polynesian varieties of sweet potato diverged from the South American varieties thousands of years before people settled in Polynesia, which suggests that the sweet potato was already present in Polynesia when people arrived.

Since 1984, new novels about young Latina characters by Latina authors have often been compared to The House on Mango Street .",A,"Choice A is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most strongly support the claim in the underlined sentence. The text begins by explaining that the portrayal of Mexican American culture in Sandra Cisneros’s The House on Mango Street inspired later authors to explore their own heritage. Noting that Cisneros’s novella was also influential for its depiction of a formative year in a female character’s youth, the text then claims that this depiction inspired other Latina authors to use fiction to explore their own experiences of youth. Since this claim addresses how Cisneros encouraged Latina authors specifically to portray their youthful experiences, it would be directly supported by such authors stating that her novella influenced them to write about their own adolescence, or the transitional period between childhood and adulthood. Choice B is incorrect. The text states that with its portrayal of Mexican American culture, The House on Mango Street inspired later authors to explore their own heritage, and since this statement isn’t limited to only Latina authors, it can be inferred that authors who aren’t Latina were also likely influenced by the novella. But because the claim in the underlined sentence concerns the novella’s influence on Latina authors specifically, the finding that the book also influenced authors who weren’t Latina would fail to provide support for the claim. Choice C is incorrect because the finding that The House on Mango Street has sold millions of copies and is widely read among students in the US doesn’t relate directly to the text’s claim that the novella has influenced Latina authors specifically. Choice D is incorrect. While comparisons of new novels about young Latina characters by Latina authors to Cisneros’s The House on Mango Stree t would likely be founded on similarities between those novels and Cisneros’s novella, such similarities wouldn’t necessarily be evidence of the novella’s influence; such similarities might arise if Cisneros and younger Latina authors alike depicted certain basic cultural and historical features of their communities. Testimony from younger Latina authors about how The House on Mango Street had inspired them would be far more persuasive evidence of the novella’s influence."

Historians find the orally transmitted stories affirming the existence of Mieszko II Lambert to be more convincing than similar stories about Siemomysł.",A,"Choice A is the best answer because it presents a statement about how historians view Siemomysł and Mieszko II Lambert that is supported by the text. The text states that the Piast dynasty had a number of different members. The text refers to two of the rulers in the Piast dynasty by name: Mieszko II Lambert, whose rule was known to have occurred from 1025 to 1031 CE, and Siemomysł (""whose historical actuality is disputed""), for whom less is known and who therefore is the subject of debate among historians. The text further casts doubt about Siemomysł by stating that he is ""said to have ruled"" during the 10th century, or the 900s, which suggests the possibility that he didn’t rule. The text also mentions that the chronicle’s documentation of Siemomysł relies on oral tradition, unlike its records of later rulers, including Mieszko II Lambert. This indicates that historians agree that Mieszko II Lambert was an actual historical figure, but they disagree about whether Siemomysł existed. Choice B is incorrect because the text states that the Gesta principum Polonorum ’s documentation of Siemomysł comes from oral tradition—spoken rather than written documentation—unlike its records of rulers who came after Siemomysł. This suggests that the chronicle provides less reliable evidence rather than more evidence for Siemomysł’s existence in the 900s (or the 10th century) than it does for later rulers like Mieszko II Lambert, who ruled from 1025 to 1031 CE. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates the opposite: Siemomysł supposedly ruled earlier in the 10th century, while Mieszko II Lambert ruled from 1025 to 1031 CE. The 10th century spans the years from 901 to 1000 CE, so Siemomysł is believed to have ruled earlier than Mieszko II Lambert did, not later as this choice states. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text mentions that information in the written chronicle Gesta principum Polonorum draws its information about Siemomysł from the oral tradition, it doesn’t mention orally transmitted stories about Mieszko II Lambert. Instead, it states that the chronicle’s documentation of Siemomysł relies on oral tradition unlike the records of later rulers do, which suggests that the documentation of later rulers such as Mieszko II Lambert did not rely on oral tradition. Thus, no comparison can be made about how convincing the orally transmitted stories of each ruler are to historians."

The researchers concluded that for the Missouri River, segments flowing into lakes tend to carry more sediment than those flowing out of lakes.","Which finding, if true, would most directly support the researchers’ conclusion?","A. The segments of the Missouri River that had higher levels of chlorophyll-a, which contributes to the green color of photosynthetic organisms, have dominant wavelengths of light between 490 and 560 nm. | B. In lakes through which segments of the Missouri River pass, the dominant wavelength of light tended to be above 560 nm near the lakes’ shores and below 560 nm in the lakes’ centers. | C. The majority of the segments of the Missouri River were found to have dominant wavelengths of light significantly higher than 560 nm. | D. Segments of the Missouri River flowing into lakes typically had dominant wavelengths of light above 560 nm, while segments flowing out of lakes typically had dominant wavelengths below 560 nm.",D,"Choice D is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would support Gardner and colleagues’ conclusion that segments of the Missouri River flowing into lakes tend to carry more sediment than do segments of the river flowing out of lakes. The text says that rivers appear yellow when they contain a lot of sediment and appear red when they contain a lot of algae. It goes on to explain that Gardner and colleagues measured the wavelengths of light for different segments of rivers in the United States and classified those wavelength measurements into colors: red for wavelengths of 495 nanometers and below, blue for wavelengths between 495 and 560 nanometers, and yellow for wavelengths of 560 nanometers and above. Combined with the earlier information about river colors, this suggests that rivers rich in sediment will have wavelengths of 560 nanometers and above (since such rivers appear yellow). If researchers found that Missouri River segments flowing into lakes tend to have wavelengths above 560 nanometers and segments flowing out of lakes tend to have wavelengths below 560 nanometers, this finding would support Gardner and colleagues’ conclusion, since it would suggest that the river tends to carry more sediment when it flows into lakes than when it flows out of lakes. Choice A is incorrect because finding that sections of the Missouri River with high chlorophyll-a levels have wavelengths between 490 and 560 nanometers would be irrelevant to the researchers’ conclusion that segments of the river flowing into lakes are richer in sediment than are segments of the river flowing out of lakes. This finding would not indicate anything about segments flowing into or out of lakes. Choice B is incorrect because finding that lakes through which the Missouri River passes have higher wavelengths near their shores than in the center would not support the researchers’ conclusion that segments of the river flowing into lakes have more sediment than segments flowing out of lakes. This finding would suggest only that there is more sediment around the edges of lakes than in their centers, which does not have any direct bearing on the researchers’ conclusion about river segments flowing into and out of lakes. Choice C is incorrect because finding that most segments of the Missouri River have wavelengths significantly higher than 560 nanometers would suggest that most segments of the river are high in sediment, not that segments flowing into lakes are higher in sediment than segments flowing out of lakes. Only a comparison of river segments flowing into lakes with segments flowing out of lakes can support the researchers’ conclusion."

The text indicates that echinoderms have radially symmetrical body plans (symmetrical around a central point, usually in the form of a star), whereas most animals have bilaterally symmetrical body plans (symmetrical along an axis running from head to tail through a trunk). According to the text, sea stars are unusual echinoderms because, despite their radial body plan, they descended from known bilateral ancestors. This shift in body plan was thought to be a process of losing the genetic markers associated with the head region. The text explains that by comparing the genes of one sea star species ( P. miniata ) to those of a close relative, the acorn worm, researchers determined that instead, anterior (head) genes are active across the sea star’s entire body, posterior (tail) genes are active in limited, peripheral locations of the body, and no trunk-related genes are active. This finding strongly suggests that, rather than becoming ""headless"" as they evolved from a bilateral ancestor, sea stars developed a body plan consisting almost entirely of a head region with a minimal tail region and no trunk region present. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t identify how any particular region of sea stars’ bodies influences the layout of sea stars’ radial symmetry. Moreover, the text indicates that the radial symmetry of echinoderms is ""usually starlike,"" not that a starlike layout distinguishes sea stars from other echinoderms. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that the idea that sea stars evolved from an ancestor with bilateral symmetry is incorrect (describing the bilateral origin as ""known"") and doesn’t address any body plans other than those with radial or bilateral symmetry. The text strongly suggests that rather than revealing something about sea stars’ origin, Formery et al.’s findings contradict the assumption that the current body plan of sea stars is ""headless."" Choice C is incorrect because the text suggests that Formery et al. were able to make determinations about P. miniata sea stars’ body plan based on the comparability of genetic markers between P. miniata and S. kowalevskii acorn worms.

According to the text, one potential explanation for humans walking upright on two legs is that the behavior evolved from an ancestor that mostly stayed on the ground and walked on four limbs, as modern chimpanzees and gorillas do. However, the finding that orangutans, also a relative of humans, sometimes stand on two legs in trees while using their arms to balance and reach for fruits suggests another possible explanation: perhaps a tree-dwelling ancestor of humans began moving on two legs because it offered an advantage, such as access to certain foods. Choice B is incorrect because the finding that modern orangutans (a relative of humans) sometimes stand on two legs in trees doesn’t offer any insight into when either bipedalism or tree-climbing behavior emerged in human ancestors. Additionally, the text indicates that one theory is that bipedalism evolved from a mostly ground-based ancestor that was already practicing knuckle-walking, not that bipedalism and knuckle-walking developed at the same time. Choice C is incorrect because the finding that orangutans (a relative of humans) sometimes stand on two legs in trees doesn’t offer any insight into how difficult it would’ve been to move between the ground and the trees without bipedalism; there’s no suggestion that climbing or moving in trees depends on the ability to walk on two legs rather than four, even if that ability might be helpful in certain circumstances.

The text goes on to say that despite the fact that the study didn’t occur near a major election, Gil de Zúñiga and Diehl still conclude that NFM may reduce voting probability. If the likelihood, or probability, that a person will vote is linked to that person’s level of political knowledge and interest, that would suggest that negatively affecting a person’s level of political knowledge and interest would also negatively affect how likely that person is to vote.

Because efficient national government is necessary to provide urban services and infrastructure that attract economic investment, Mahtta et al. propose that absent other factors, the importance of GDP per capita growth to ULE would likely increase relative to the importance of population growth as governments become more efficient.

According to the text, ULE is influenced by urban population growth and by gross domestic product (GDP) growth per capita. Reasoning that efficient national governments provide urban services and infrastructure needed to attract economic investment, Mahtta et al. suggest that, as governments become more efficient at providing urban services and infrastructure, GDP growth per capita will account for more ULE and urban population growth will account for less. But according to the graph, Region 1 saw an increase in the percentage attributed to urban population growth from 1970–2000 (between 60 and 65%) to 2000–2014 (between 70 and 75%) and a decrease in the percentage attributed to GDP growth per capita from 1970–2000 (between 35 and 40%) to 2000–2014 (about 25%). Because the percentage attributed to GDP growth per capita decreased (the opposite of what Mahtta et al. claimed would happen if the governments had become more efficient), the data suggest that the governments of Region 1 became less efficient at providing urban services and infrastructure over that period. Choice B is incorrect. Neither the graph nor the text gives the regions’ relative levels of economic growth or what effect Mahtta et al. would expect such growth to have. Furthermore, Mahtta et al.’s proposal suggests that Region 1’s decline in the percentage of ULE attributed to GDP growth per capita from 1970–2000 (between 35 and 40%) to 2000–2014 (about 25%) would suggest decreasing, not increasing, government efficiency over this time. Choice C is incorrect. Neither the text nor the graph provides information about the relative efficiencies of different governments in Region 2. Choice D is incorrect. Mahtta et al.’s proposal suggests that more efficient governments will have a higher percentage of their ULE driven by GDP growth per capita and a lower percentage driven by urban population growth. For Region 2, the percentage of ULE attributed to GDP growth per capita increased from 1970–2000 (between 10 and 15%) to 2000–2014 (between 45 and 50%), but the opposite is true for Region 1, which saw the percentage of ULE attributed to GDP growth per capita decline over the same period. Thus, whereas the data suggest governments in Region 2 became more efficient, the data for Region 1 suggest that those governments became less efficient, not more."

One means of trade liberalization involves expanding from ordinary imports into an emphasis on processing imports, which have two types: processing with assembly (in which a firm obtains raw materials from a foreign trading partner without payment and sells the final goods to that partner, charging for assembly) and processing with inputs (in which a firm expends capital to buy raw materials from a trading partner, processes them into final goods, and sells those goods to whichever trading partner it chooses).

Processing imports with assembly were greater in 2006 than processing imports with inputs in 2000.",B,"Choice B is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that best support the student’s assertion that initial efforts at trade liberalization in China were shaped by firms having limited capital (assets available for use) and that this situation resolved during the 2000s. The text explains that an approach to trade liberalization involves engaging in processing imports, one type of which doesn’t require payment to a trade partner (processing with assembly) and one type of which requires upfront payment to a trade partner for raw materials (processing with inputs). The graph, which presents China’s imports for ordinary imports and both types of processing imports in the years 2000, 2003, and 2006, shows that while processing imports with assembly rose from about 250 hundred million dollars in 2000 to about 750 hundred million dollars in 2006, processing imports with inputs rose much more sharply, increasing from approximately 650 hundred million dollars in 2000 to about 2,300 hundred million dollars in 2006. Because processing with inputs requires firms to pay for materials (expending capital) and processing with assembly doesn’t, the sharper rise in processing imports with inputs suggests that Chinese firms’ assets—and thus their ability to engage in that type of processing imports—were relatively limited in (and before) 2000 and then substantially increased from 2000 to 2006. In other words, the data suggest that the situation of having limited capital resolved during the 2000s. Choice A is incorrect because the graph indicates that ordinary imports were greater than both types of processing imports in 2006, not that processing imports with inputs were greater than ordinary imports and processing imports with assembly that year. Choice C is incorrect because the observation that ordinary imports were greater than both types of processing imports in 2000, 2003, and 2006 doesn’t address a change within any type of imports from 2000 to 2006, and an indication of a change in that period that might be related to the availability of assets is needed to support the assertion that the situation of having limited capital resolved during the 2000s. Choice D is incorrect because the fact that processing imports with assembly were greater at the end of the period from 2000 to 2006 than processing imports with inputs were at the start of the same period doesn’t address a change within either type of imports during the period, and an indication of such a change that might be related to the availability of assets is needed to support the assertion that the situation of having limited capital resolved during the 2000s."

The text explains that it’s hard for researchers to test for the effects that elected office has on people because finding people to serve as a control group is difficult. The text indicates that a control group needs to be made up of people who share characteristics of the group being tested but don’t have the variable being tested (in this case, holding elected office). Because researchers aren’t able to influence who wins elections, they’re also unable to determine who would serve as an appropriately similar member of a control group. Thus, it logically follows that researchers will find it difficult to identify a group of people who can function as an appropriate control group for their studies. Choice A is incorrect because the text focuses on the struggle to put together a control group for experiments; it doesn’t suggest that finding information about politicians’ behavior is difficult. Choice B is incorrect because the experiments mentioned in the text are testing the effects of holding elected office on a person’s behavior. Studying people who have already held elected office wouldn’t provide an opportunity to note any behavioral changes that the position might cause.

Furthermore, the study in the text suggests that in-person stores may actually be able to charge more for a given product, since shoppers can touch it. Choice D is incorrect. The text doesn’t discuss products that are only available online, so there’s not much basis for this claim. Furthermore, products only available online would still have the problem of shoppers not being able to touch them, and the study suggests that this lowers the prices shoppers are willing to pay."

This may appear counterintuitive—resource extraction requires initial investments (in extractive technology, for instance) at scales best met by multinational corporations—but Asiedu notes that natural-resource industries’ boom-bust cycle can destabilize local currencies and increase developing countries’ vulnerability to external shocks, creating levels of uncertainty to which foreign investors are typically averse.",Which choice best states the main idea of the text?,"A. Although it may seem surprising that foreign investment declines in developing countries as natural-resource extraction makes up a larger share of those countries’ economies, that decline happens because resource extraction requires initial investments too large for foreign investors to supply. | B. Although developing countries tend to become less dependent on foreign investment as natural-resource industries make up a larger share of their economies, this change may not occur if the boom-bust cycle of those industries destabilizes local currencies or increases countries’ vulnerability to external shocks. | C. Although one might expect that foreign investment would increase as natural-resource extraction makes up a larger share of developing countries’ economies, the opposite happens because heavy reliance on natural resources can lead to unattractive conditions for investors. | D. Although foreign investors tend to avoid initial investments in natural-resource industries in developing countries, foreign investment may increase significantly as those industries stabilize and the risks associated with them decline.",C,"Choice C is the best answer because it accurately states the main idea of the text. According to the text, contrary to what some might expect, foreign investment is typically lower in developing countries whose economies are more dependent on natural-resource extraction. The text explains that high reliance on natural-resource extraction can subject a developing country to economic shocks that can destabilize the local currency and introduce economic uncertainty that tends to keep investors away. In other words, although we may think otherwise, foreign investors are less willing to invest in projects in developing countries whose economies are heavily dependent on natural-resource extraction because those economies tend to exhibit instability that investors want to avoid. Choice A is incorrect. The text does indicate that foreign investment is typically lower in developing countries whose economies are more dependent on natural-resource extraction; the text further indicates that natural-resource extraction requires substantial initial investments (to acquire things like required technologies) for which there are fewer investors willing to participate at this stage than one might think. But the text does not implicate the cost of these initial investments as a reason why foreign investment is less widely available than some might think. Choice B is incorrect. The text indicates that greater dependence on natural-resource extraction makes a developing country less appealing to foreign investors because of associated economic instability. Rather than arguing that the goal of developing countries is to become less dependent on foreign investment, as the phrasing of choice B suggests, the text focuses only on why foreign investors become less involved with such countries, which suggests that more investment would be preferable. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text indicates that natural-resource extraction requires substantial initial investments (to acquire things like required technologies) and that there are fewer likely investors willing to participate at this stage than one might think, the text does not address what investors are likely to do over time as the industry stabilizes itself."

The text states that the Minneapolis Institute of Art has more than 90,000 artworks. It goes on to explain that images of a subset of these works can be viewed online, such as an image of Armajani’s drawing Mississippi Delta . The text then presents a student’s claim that online images of art can increase the number of people who experience the work. If more people view Armajani’s drawing online than they do in person, this finding would support the student’s claim about the benefits of putting a work from the museum online. Thus, this finding would most directly support the claim because, if it were true, more people would view Mississippi Delta online than would visit the entire museum in person. Choice A is incorrect because information about the museum having several works by Armajani wouldn’t address the student’s claim about how putting artworks online affects the number of people who experience them. The quantity of works by one artist that are held in a museum collection wouldn’t support a claim about audience size or the impact of online accessibility. Choice B is incorrect because opinions about the museum would only relate to the institution’s reputation. This finding wouldn’t provide information about online accessibility or whether digital images increase the number of people who view specific artworks. Choice C is incorrect because critics’ praise for Mississippi Delta wouldn’t address the student’s claim about how online access increases the number of people who can experience a work.

The text states that although it has been hypothesized that birds’ bill size should increase with habitat temperature (an adaptation that reflects the fact that birds can release excess heat through their bills), Probst and colleagues concluded after studying mean bill surface area in North American thrashers that this hypothesis was not fully supported. In other words, Probst and colleagues did not observe the predicted positive relationship between mean bill surface area and habitat temperature in the thrashers they studied. The data in the table about the ocellated thrasher support Probst and colleagues’ conclusion because this species has the greatest mean bill surface area (3.26 cm 2 cm squared ), but its habitat has the lowest mean maximum temperature in the warmest month (27.56°C). If the hypothesis were fully supported, species such as the ocellated thrasher that have colder habitats would likely also have smaller bills. Similarly, the data about the Bendire’s thrasher support Probst and colleagues’ conclusion because this species has the second-smallest mean bill surface area (1.98 cm 2 cm squared ), yet its habitat has the highest mean maximum temperature in the warmest month (36.57°C). If the hypothesis were fully supported, the Bendire’s thrasher and other species with warmer habitats would also have larger bills. Because data in the table show that the ocellated thrasher and the Bendire’s thrasher have the opposite or near opposite of the hypothesized relationship between bill size and habitat temperature, these examples support Probst and colleagues’ conclusion that this hypothesis isn’t fully supported. Choice A is incorrect because it misrepresents the data in the table. Although the Bendire’s thrasher has the second-smallest mean bill surface area of the species that are included in the table and although its habitat has the second-lowest mean minimum temperature in the coldest month, this habitat has the highest (rather than the lowest) mean maximum temperature in the warmest month. Moreover, the data about this species’ bill surface area and mean minimum temperature suggest that smaller bills are associated with colder habitats, supporting rather than challenging the hypothesis that bill size increases with habitat temperature. Choice B is incorrect because it misrepresents the data in the table. Although the Cozumel thrasher has the second-greatest mean bill surface area of the species that are included in the table, its habitat’s mean maximum temperature in the warmest month is not ""significantly higher"" than the mean maximum temperatures of the other habitats. On the contrary, the mean maximum temperature of the Cozumel thrasher’s habitat is lower than that observed for the habitats of both the Bendire’s thrasher and the long-billed thrasher. Choice C is incorrect because it misrepresents the data in the table. Although this choice accurately describes the brown thrasher’s mean bill surface area and habitat temperature, it incorrectly states that the long-billed thrasher has the second-largest (rather than the third-largest) mean bill surface area of the species included.

Churchill’s play was influenced by Brecht’s belief that theater should elicit an intellectual rather than an emotional response from audiences, making them think about social and political issues that also exist outside of the play. Therefore, it makes sense that Churchill would strive to have audiences think dispassionately (i.e., without emotion) and critically about the social and political questions raised by the play. Choice A is incorrect. The passage mentions that Churchill was influenced by Brecht’s belief that plays should provoke audience members “to consider social and political realities that extend beyond the characters and events depicted onstage,” so there’s no basis for an inference about audience members deeply engaging with characters’ beliefs and actions. Choice B is incorrect. Reflecting on things that aren’t related to patriarchy and colonialism wouldn’t “engage audiences in an interrogation of patriarchy and colonialism.” That creates a confusing contradiction.

The text states that some scholars have dated the composition of Beowulf to the late ninth through early eleventh centuries due to the poem’s fit with that period’s historical context. The text goes on to say that while it is “not inconceivable that Beowulf emerged from such a context”—that is, it is possible that Beowulf was composed during the late ninth through eleventh centuries—there is linguistic evidence that the poem was composed earlier, in the seventh or eighth century. According to the text, favoring the historical context over the linguistic evidence requires justification that scholars have not yet supplied. In other words, the text suggests that scholars who favor the later composition date need to explain why the poem’s fit with historical context should take precedence over the linguistic evidence, but they have not yet done so. Thus, the main idea of the text is that while there is some plausibility to the later composition date, advocates for the later date have not compellingly addressed evidence suggestive of an earlier date.

This can be seen most clearly by comparing the employment by sector in both countries in ______ blank",Which choice most effectively uses data from the table to complete the statement?,A. 1900 with the employment by sector in 1950. | B. 1800 with the employment by sector in 2012. | C. 1900 with the employment by sector in 2012. | D. 1800 with the employment by sector in 1900.,A,"Choice A is the best answer because it presents data from the table that most effectively complete the statement about the rates at which employment shifted in France and the United States. The text states that over the last two hundred years employment in the agricultural sector has declined while employment in the service sector has risen in both France and the US, and the data from the table reflect these trends. The text asserts, however, that the transition from agriculture to services “happened at very different rates in the two countries.” This assertion is best supported by a comparison of data from 1900 and 1950: the table shows that in those years, employment in agriculture went from 43% to 32% in France (a decline of 11 percentage points) and from 41% to 14% in the US (a decline of 27 percentage points), and that employment in services went from 28% to 35% in France (an increase of 7 percentage points) and from 31% to 53% in the US (an increase of 22 percentage points). In other words, the rate of change was greater in the US than in France for both sectors. Choice B is incorrect because comparing the data for 1800 and 2012 would suggest a similar rate of change in the two countries, not very different rates: employment in agriculture went from 64% in 1800 to 3% in 2012 in France, which is close to the change from 68% in 1800 to 2% in 2012 in the US, while employment in services went from 14% in 1800 to 76% in 2012 in France, which is close to the change from 13% in 1800 to 80% in 2012 in the US. Choice C is incorrect because comparing the data for 1900 and 2012 would suggest a similar rate of change in the two countries rather than very different rates: employment in agriculture went from 43% in 1900 to 3% in 2012 in France, which is close to the change from 41% in 1900 to 2% in 2012 in the US, while employment in services went from 28% in 1900 to 76% in 2012 in France, which is close to the change from 31% in 1900 to 80% in 2012 in the US. Choice D is incorrect because comparing the data for 1800 and 1900 would suggest a similar rate of change in the two countries, not very different rates: employment in agriculture went from 64% in 1800 to 43% in 1900 in France, which is fairly close to the change from 68% in 1800 to 41% in 1900 in the US, while employment in services went from 14% in 1800 to 28% in 1900 in France, which is close to the change from 13% in 1800 to 31% in 1900 in the US."

The recent verification of a pathway between the VTA and the cerebellum confirms the cerebellum’s long-suspected role in motor coordination. | B. Recent advances in the field of neuroscience have challenged widely accepted claims about the function of a pathway connecting the VTA and the cerebellum. | C. The cerebellum has primarily been thought to regulate motor functioning, but in recent years neuroscience researchers have been uncovering additional functions. | D.

The text says that the cerebellum has long been thought to regulate motor functioning, but new research shows that it may also have other functions—including regulating emotion and social behavior and some connection to motivation and rewards processing. Choice A is incorrect. The VTA is described as “a center for motivation and reward processing,” and the discovery of the pathway between the VTA and the cerebellum supports the theory that the cerebellum is involved in functions other than motor coordination. Choice B is incorrect. The text says that recent research has identified this pathway, but it doesn’t discuss any previous “widely accepted claims” about the pathway’s function. The “widespread acknowledgement” mentioned early in the passage is about the cerebellum alone, not its connection to the VTA. Choice D is incorrect.

In June there are slightly less than 300 hours of sunshine in Anchorage and slightly less than 350 hours in Fairbanks. Then, in July there are approximately 250 hours of sunshine in both cities.

The text explains that Vaiglova, Liu, and their colleagues analyzed the chemical composition of sheep, goat, and cattle bones from the Bronze Age in China in order to investigate the animals’ domestication, or their adaptation from a wild state to a state in which they existed in close connection with humans. According to the text, the team’s analysis showed that sheep and goats of the era fed largely on wild plants, whereas cattle fed on millet—importantly, a crop cultivated by humans. If analysis of the animal bones shows that the cattle’s diet also consisted of wheat, another crop cultivated by humans in China during the Bronze Age, the finding would support the team’s conclusion by offering additional evidence that cattle during this era fed on human-grown crops—and, by extension, that humans raised cattle relatively close to the settlements where they grew these crops, leaving goats and sheep to roam farther away in areas with wild vegetation, uncultivated by humans. Choice B is incorrect because if it were true that sheep’s and goats’ diets consisted of small portions of millet, which the text states was a crop cultivated by humans, the finding would suggest that sheep and goats were raised relatively close to human settlements, weakening the team’s conclusion that cattle were likely raised closer to those settlements than sheep and goats were. Choice C is incorrect because the finding that cattle generally require more food and nutrients than do sheep and goats wouldn’t support the team’s conclusion that cattle were likely raised closer to human settlements than sheep and goats were. Nothing in the text suggests that cattle were incapable of obtaining sufficient food and nutrients without access to human-grown crops. Hence, even if cattle’s diets are found to have different requirements than the diets of sheep and goats, the cattle could have met those requirements from food located far from human settlements. Choice D is incorrect because if it were true that the diets of sheep, goats, and cattle varied based on what the farmers in each Bronze Age settlement could grow, the finding would weaken the team’s conclusion that cattle were likely raised closer to human settlements than sheep and goats were, suggesting instead that all three types of animals were raised close enough to human settlements to feed on those settlements’ crops."

The text indicates that scholars used to believe that during the Classic period, the Maya civilization didn’t have agricultural marketplaces. According to the text, scholars held this view because they misunderstood the ecology of areas where the Maya lived. The text points out that people tend to create marketplaces in order to acquire resources they don’t otherwise control. Agricultural marketplaces would have allowed farmers who produced one type of crop to trade that crop for other types of crops that they didn’t produce. The text goes on to say, however, that scholars underestimated the ecological diversity of the Maya areas, meaning that scholars thought that the Maya landscape produced a smaller range of resources than it actually produced. Taken together, then, this information suggests that scholars assumed that marketplaces wouldn’t have allowed Maya people to acquire products different from the products they already produced: that is, if everyone produced the same array of crops, as scholars mistakenly believed, then there wouldn’t have been any need for marketplaces where people could trade those crops. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t say anything about trade between the Maya and people from outside the regions controlled by the Maya. Although scholars’ mistaken belief that the Maya lands weren’t very ecologically diverse would give those scholars a reason to think that the Maya didn’t have marketplaces, it wouldn’t lead scholars to assume that traders from outside Maya lands were uninterested in acquiring resources produced by the Maya. Even if the Maya actually did produce only a small array of resources throughout their lands, there is no reason to believe from the text that people outside Maya lands also produced these same resources and thus would have no need to trade with the Maya people. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that scholars underestimated the ecological diversity of the Maya lands, which suggests that they mistakenly believed that the Maya produced a relatively small array of resources throughout their territory, not that the crops the Maya produced varied significantly throughout the Maya lands. Although the scholars might have assumed that a lack of ecological diversity suggests that Maya farming practices were largely the same everywhere, the text does not support that they also assumed there was a lot of variation in the crops that Maya people produced. In fact, the text states that marketplaces emerge when people want to obtain resources they don’t already control. If it were the case that scholars assumed that the crops Maya people produced varied significantly, this would have led them to conclude that Maya people likely established marketplaces so they could trade for resources they didn’t already possess, not that the Maya civilization lacked marketplaces. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that scholars assumed that farmers wouldn’t trade their agricultural products unless they had already met their own needs with those products. Instead, the text says that scholars thought that the Maya lands produced a smaller array of resources than they actually did, which the text suggests led scholars to assume that the Maya didn’t have any need for marketplaces. The scholars’ mistaken belief has no bearing on the issue of whether farmers met their own needs before trading their products."

The text begins by acknowledging that in 2022, Dimopoulos et al. were justified in arguing for antigravity on theoretical grounds because although there was no experimental evidence supporting its existence at that time, there was no evidence contradicting its existence either. The text then introduces the 2023 report describing an experiment that produced observations ""thoroughly inconsistent with antigravity."" Thus, the main idea is that while the study of antigravity was theoretically justified before the 2023 report (due to lack of evidence against it), the report’s findings undermine the rationale for such theoretical consideration since there is now evidence against this hypothetical phenomenon. Choice A is incorrect. Although antihydrogen ballistics observations were conducted at CERN, the text provides no evidence that they were conducted to test conclusions in Dimopoulos et al.’s 2022 paper. Rather, the text presents the 2023 report as new evidence that contradicts the existence of the hypothetical phenomenon that Dimopoulos et al. had considered. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that Dimopoulos et al. assumed that unambiguous proof of antigravity would be unattainable. Rather, the text states that they argued antigravity was worth considering theoretically because evidence against it was lacking at that time. At the same time, the results in the 2023 report do not undermine but strengthen the idea that the proof of antigravity might not be achievable. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that there was an ""inordinate focus on theoretical considerations"" before 2023 or that such a focus hindered the development of experimental methods. In fact, the text describes Dimopoulos et al.’s position regarding the theoretical consideration of antigravity as ""rightly argued,"" indicating approval of their approach given the absence of experimental evidence at that time."

The text states that modern alpacas get only 64 percent of their genetic material from their wild ancestor (the vicuña), while llamas get 95.5 percent of their genetic material from their wild ancestor (the guanaco). These data imply that relative to llamas, alpacas have experienced a much greater genetic shift away from their wild ancestors (36 percent of their genetic material derives from another source, compared to 4.5 percent of llamas’ genetic material). Moreover, the text establishes that the remainder of alpacas’ genetic material derives from llamas, and the remainder of llamas’ genetic material derives from alpacas, reflecting a period of interbreeding. Taken together, these details support the inference that the period of interbreeding had a more significant impact on the genetic material of alpacas than on that of llamas, thereby reducing the percentage of alpacas’ genetic material that derives from wild ancestors and placing alpacas at a greater remove from these ancestors. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t provide information about genetic diversity within modern llama and alpaca populations. While the text discusses the percentage of genetic material each domesticated species inherited from its wild ancestor and from interbreeding, it does not address the level of genetic variation within each species. Therefore, it isn’t logical to infer that modern llama populations have a greater degree of genetic diversity than modern alpaca populations do. Choice B is incorrect because it contradicts the chronology presented in the text. The text states that alpacas were domesticated about 7,000 years ago, but the interbreeding with llamas occurred ""between 400 and 600 years ago."" The genetic mixing happened thousands of years after domestication, not during it; in addition, the text does not provide details about what the process of domestication might entail. Therefore, it isn’t logical to infer that llama genetic material was introduced during the domestication process of alpacas. Choice D is incorrect because though the text notes that guanacos and vicuñas contributed to the genetic material of alpacas and llamas, it only discusses alpacas’ and llamas’ genetic composition.

The text indicates that dog owners typically claim that some dog breeds are “more likely than others to have particular personality traits.” In other words, the text points out that a commonly held belief about dog breeds is that their personality traits are heritable. The text then states that Kathleen Morrill and colleagues undertook research about dog trait heritability and found that “behavior varies widely among dogs of the same breed.” Because Morrill and colleagues found evidence for variability rather than consistency in the behavior of dogs of the same breed, the statement that research fails to uphold a commonly held belief about dog breeds and behavior accurately reflects the main idea of the text. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text mentions that humans have long intervened in dogs’ reproduction by intentionally crossbreeding certain dogs, it doesn’t argue that such intervention is essential to the existence of dog breeds. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t discuss the popularity of any dog breeds; breeds are mentioned as having certain traits, but the text says nothing about the popularity of these breeds or traits.

The text explains that fan cells—a type of brain cell—are necessary for the acquisition of new associative memories, and that activity among these cells requires a chemical known as dopamine, which the brain produces in response to rewards. Since the brain cells that enable the formation of associative memories require dopamine in order to function, and since the brain produces dopamine in response to rewards, it can be inferred that receiving a reward should likely help to increase an individual’s capacity to form associative memories. Choice A is incorrect because the relationship between rewards and dopamine sketched by the text is that rewards result in the production of dopamine, not that they cause an individual’s capacity to utilize dopamine to decrease. Choice B is incorrect. The text suggests that receiving a reward would produce dopamine and thereby assist with associative memory formation. However, the text never suggests that associative memory involves the capacity to recognize differences between unrelated things, indicating only that associative memory involves remembering what connects those things.

The text indicates that the proportion of military veterans working in civilian government jobs is considerably higher than the proportion of military veterans in the population as a whole. The text also notes that the unusually high representation of military veterans in these jobs may be a result of the organizational structures shared by civilian government entities and the military. Hence, it’s reasonable to infer that it’s the familiarity of the structures of civilian government that makes jobs there particularly attractive to military veterans. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t address what a typical relationship between military service and later career preferences would be, and there’s no indication that it’s atypical for veterans to work in civilian government jobs after they’ve left the military. On the contrary, the text suggests that many military veterans are drawn to such jobs. Choice C is incorrect because the text is focused on the high representation of military veterans in civilian government jobs and doesn’t address nonveterans or their possible interest in military service.

A study led by Valerie Payré focused on additional information—further analysis of data collected by the spacecraft and infrared wavelengths detected from Mars’s surface—that revealed the presence of surprisingly high concentrations of silica in certain regions on Mars.

The text explains that while many pleasant families live in the city of S., inhabitants of the city consider the Turkins to be ""the most accomplished and most enlightened family of all."" Thus, by indicating that they are seen as more accomplished and more enlightened than all the other families in the city of S., the text suggests that the Turkins have a unique status there. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t indicate that the Turkins have recently moved to the city of S.; it provides no information about when the Turkins arrived. Choice C is incorrect because the text explains how the Turkins are viewed by others in the city of S. but gives no indication of how the Turkins feel about living there. Choice D is incorrect because the text explains how the Turkins are viewed by other residents of the city of S. but gives no indication of how the Turkins view the other residents."

The spider population count was the same in both enclosures on day 1. | B. The spider population count also substantially declined by day 30 in the enclosure without lizards. | C. The largest decline in spider population count in the enclosure with lizards occurred from day 1 to day 10. | D. The spider population count on day 30 was lower in the enclosure with lizards than in the enclosure without lizards.,B,"Choice B is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that weaken the student’s conclusion about the reduction in the spider population in the enclosure with lizards. The graph shows that the enclosure with lizards and the enclosure without lizards each began with about 85 spiders, and that the number of spiders in each enclosure fell over the 30 days of the study. The student’s claim is that the reduction in spiders in the enclosure with lizards is “entirely attributable to the presence of the lizards,” meaning that the spider population wouldn’t have declined except for the presence of the lizards. This claim is weakened, however, by the fact that the enclosure without lizards also saw a substantial reduction in the number of spiders. Since the number of spiders fell in the enclosure without lizards as well as in the enclosure with lizards, there must be some other factor than just the presence of the lizards that contributed to the reduction in the spider population. Choice A is incorrect because the fact that the two enclosures started with the same number of spiders is irrelevant to the claim that the reduction in spider population by day 30 in the enclosure with lizards can be entirely attributed to the lizards. Choice C is incorrect because the fact that the spider population in the enclosure with lizards fell more between days 1 and 10 than in other periods has nothing to do with the student’s claim that the reduction in spiders in that enclosure by day 30 can be entirely attributed to the lizards. Choice D is incorrect. Although it’s true that on day 30 the spider population was lower in the enclosure with lizards than in the enclosure without lizards, this fact doesn’t weaken the student’s claim that the reduction in the spider population in the enclosure with lizards can be entirely attributed to the lizards. Indeed, the lower spider population in the enclosure with lizards suggests that the lizards are contributing to the reduction in the spider population, though the fact that the spider population also fell substantially in the other enclosure means that the lizards aren’t the only cause of the reduction."

The text establishes that sauropods evolved to reach enormous sizes, and it notes that some scientists have asserted that the cause of this phenomenon was increased plant production that resulted from increased atmospheric carbon dioxide. The text goes on to state, however, that atmospheric carbon dioxide levels didn’t increase around the time of important periods in sauropods’ evolution of larger body sizes. If significant periods of sauropod evolution toward larger sizes occurred without increased atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, that suggests that the evolution of larger sizes didn’t depend on increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t describe any fluctuations in atmospheric carbon dioxide, so there’s no evidence in the text to support the conclusion that such fluctuations had different effects on different sauropod lineages. All that the text says about atmospheric carbon dioxide levels is that there weren’t increases at particular points that correspond with key moments in sauropod evolution. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that there weren’t significant increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide around the time of important periods in sauropods’ evolution toward larger body sizes, not that atmospheric carbon dioxide was higher when the largest sauropods lived than when sauropods first appeared. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that atmospheric carbon dioxide levels didn’t increase at important periods in sauropod evolution, not that higher levels would have affected that evolution.

The text notes that jaguars generally eat land-based mammals, but researchers claim that jaguars in the Pantanal can survive on a diet that includes more fish and aquatic reptiles than mammals. Finding that the remains of aquatic reptiles and fish appear more often in these jaguars’ waste than the remains of mammals do would support the researchers’ claim, since it would suggest that fish and aquatic reptiles are a more significant part of the jaguars’ diet than mammals are. Choice B is incorrect because finding that a particular aquatic reptile exists in high numbers in the area would not support the researchers’ claim about the jaguars’ diet. The mere presence of many aquatic reptiles nearby does not mean that the jaguars eat those reptiles, let alone survive on more aquatic reptiles and fish than mammals. Choice C is incorrect. Although finding that aquatic reptiles and fish can provide nutrients that land mammals typically do not provide could help explain why some animals eat those reptiles and fish, it would not indicate whether the jaguars in particular eat those reptiles and fish and thus would not support the researchers’ claim. Choice D is incorrect because finding that when preying on mammals, jaguars prefer semiaquatic mammals, such as capybaras, would be irrelevant to the researchers’ claim that the jaguars can survive on a diet of more fish and aquatic reptiles than mammals.

In the text, the narrator states that after arriving at the camp, he found it to be different than he’d expected and that as a result, he felt ""scared, but also excited."" Choice A is incorrect. In the text, the narrator describes himself as ""excited."" Although excitement is a positive emotion, it isn’t as intensely positive as feeling overjoyed is. Moreover, the narrator also notes that he felt ""scared."" In other words, his excitement (a positive emotion) is balanced with fear (a negative emotion).

The Affect Mode describes choices based on the decision-maker’s preferred emotional outcome, the Role Mode describes choices based on the decision-maker’s social motivations, and the Calculation Mode describes choices based on minimizing financial costs and maximizing the decision-maker’s convenience. Thus, if those using a Calculation Mode disfavor the green plan, it would be due to some financial or convenience burden the green plan imposes that the other doesn’t. The text indicates that the green plan had a lower financial cost but was nonetheless rejected by participants using the Calculation Mode. It therefore follows that the green plan likely imposed a convenience burden that outweighed potential financial savings for these participants. Choice A is incorrect. According to the text, the Affect Mode involves the decision-maker’s preferred emotional outcome, the Role Mode involves social motivations, and the Calculation Mode is oriented toward minimizing financial costs and maximizing the decision-maker’s convenience. Thus, unlike the Affect or Role Modes, the Calculation Mode would almost certainly involve taking price differences into account. Choice B is incorrect. According to the text, the Affect Mode involves the decision-maker’s preferred emotional outcome, the Role Mode involves social motivations, and the Calculation Mode is oriented toward minimizing financial costs and maximizing the decision-maker’s convenience.

According to the text, A. mexicanus , a river-dwelling fish species, has colonized caves. The fish that live in rivers and those that live in caves show no significant genetic differences and are all capable of making the same sounds. The text indicates, however, that Hyacinthe and colleagues found that sounds that the river fish use in a particular context and for a particular purpose are used in a different context and for a different purpose by the cave fish. Additionally, the sounds made by cave fish show some differences depending on the specific cave the fish inhabit. The text goes on to state that Hyacinthe and colleagues have noted that differences in how the fish use sound to communicate could eventually become so great that they prevent fish from different locations from interbreeding. In other words, the river fish might eventually only breed with other river fish (with whom they share characteristics regarding sonic communication that they do not share with cave fish), while the cave fish might only breed with other cave fish for a similar reason. In context, this observation suggests that even though the fish are a single species right now, they could be in the process of splitting into distinct populations with different characteristics. Choice A is incorrect because there is no information in the text suggesting that the river fish are less reliant on sonic communication than the cave fish are. Although the text does indicate that the river fish and cave fish are genetically similar, the text describes both groups as using sonic communication and says nothing to indicate that one group depends on that communication more than the other group does.

Keltner, along with Paul K. Piff, Pia Dietze, and colleagues, claims to have found evidence for this effect in a recent study where participants were asked to either gaze up at exceptionally tall trees in a nearby grove (reported to be a universally awe-inspiring experience) or stare at the exterior of a nearby, nondescript building. After one minute, an experimenter deliberately spilled a box of pens nearby.","Which finding from the researchers’ study, if true, would most strongly support their claim?","A. Participants who had been looking at the trees helped the experimenter pick up significantly more pens than did participants who had been looking at the building. | B.

Participants who did not help the experimenter pick up the pens were significantly more likely to report having experienced a feeling of awe, regardless of whether they looked at the building or the trees. | D. Participants who had been looking at the building were significantly more likely to notice that the experimenter had dropped the pens than were participants who had been looking at the trees.",A,"Choice A is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most strongly support the researchers’ claim that they found evidence that experiencing awe can make people feel more connected to others and thus more likely to behave altruistically (with beneficial and unselfish concern for others). According to the text, the researchers tested for this effect by first having participants look at either something known to be awe-inspiring (very tall trees) or something ordinary (a plain building) and then purposely spilling pens near the participants. The finding that participants who had looked at the trees helped pick up significantly more pens than did participants who had looked at the building would support the researchers’ claim by demonstrating that the people who had experienced awe behaved more altruistically when the experimenter needed help than the other participants did. Choice B is incorrect because a finding about helpful participants using positive words to describe the trees and the building after the experiment was over wouldn’t have any bearing on the researchers’ claim that experiencing awe increases altruistic behavior. The text doesn’t address the use of positive words to describe things or suggest any connection between using such words and having experienced awe, so that behavior wouldn’t serve as evidence that experiencing awe played a role in promoting helpful behavior. Choice C is incorrect because a finding that participants who didn’t help the experimenter were significantly more likely than others to report having experienced awe whether they had looked at the building or the trees would weaken the researchers’ claim that experiencing awe increases altruistic behavior by suggesting that the opposite might be true—that experiencing awe is in fact linked to choosing not to act in a way that benefits someone else. Choice D is incorrect because a finding about participants noticing that the experimenter had dropped the pens wouldn’t have any bearing on the researchers’ claim about people behaving altruistically. Being aware of a challenge or problem isn’t necessarily beneficial on its own and isn’t the same as offering help, so the finding wouldn’t support the idea that experiencing awe increases altruistic behavior."

Testing the thermomechanical properties of several commercially available SiC fibers, Ramakrishna T.

The text states that Bhatt et al. found that a nitrogen-treated SiC fiber had a lower minimum creep rate than two polymer-derived SiC fibers did. Because having a lower creep rate means that the material is slower to deform with exposure to stress, as the text explains, this finding suggests that aerospace composites made with the nitrogen-treated SiC fiber may be able to withstand mechanical stress for a longer period than those made with the other two polymer-derived SiC fibers can. Choice A is incorrect because it overstates the implications of the study’s findings, which have to do with the rate of a material’s deformation under stress, not the absolute degree of deformation. The text states that Bhatt et al. observed that a nitrogen-treated SiC fiber had a lower minimum creep rate than two polymer-derived SiC fibers did, meaning only that it deformed more slowly over time under constant stress, not that it underwent less deformation overall. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t establish any similarity between the two polymer-derived SiC fibers other than that both had a higher creep rate than the nitrogen-treated SiC fiber did in Bhatt et al.’s study. Moreover, reducing a material’s resistance to creep would mean that the material becomes more susceptible to deformation with exposure to stress and elevated temperatures, which would be expected to shorten rather than prolong the lifespan of machinery made with that material. Choice C is incorrect because the text suggests that the stability of aerospace equipment may be better improved by composites containing nitrogen-treated SiC fiber than by composites containing the two polymer-derived SiC fibers, not the other way around. The text indicates that Bhatt et al. observed that the nitrogen-treated SiC fiber had a lower minimum creep rate than the other two fibers did, meaning that it was slower to degrade under exposure to mechanical stress and elevated temperatures—suggesting that it may remain stable for longer periods."

The amount of zinc in plants without kanamycin exposure is around 400 parts per million, while the amount of zinc in plants with kanamycin exposure is lower, at around 300 parts per million. Similarly, the amount of iron in plants without kanamycin exposure is a little over 600 parts per million, while the amount of iron in plants with kanamycin exposure is lower, at a little over 200 parts per million. Thus, the graph shows that plants with kanamycin exposure have significantly lower levels of both iron and zinc than the plants without kanamycin exposure.

The team tested this idea by asking human participants to look for both iridescent beetle wings and beetle wings that weren’t iridescent but that had been painted colors such as purple or blue.

The text first describes what paleontologists initially speculated to be true of T. navigans based on observing only fossilized skulls of the pterosaur rather than complete skeletons—namely, that T. navigans had an oversized head crest and that, like other pterosaurs, its main mode of movement must have been flight. The text goes on to describe what researcher Victor Beccari and his team concluded based on studying a nearly complete fossilized skeleton of T. navigans , which provided additional information that fossilized skulls alone could not. Beccari and colleagues determined that T. navigans had long hind legs, short wings, and an unusually long neck, in addition to the oversized head crest previously observed by paleontologists. Taken together, these characteristics would have made sustained flight difficult and upright walking comfortable, which would make T. navigans different from other pterosaurs that moved mainly through flight.

Therefore, Beccari’s team would not suggest that T. navigans flew for longer distances than did other pterosaur species with large head crests. Choice B is incorrect because the fossilized skeleton studied by Beccari and colleagues was notable for its short wings, and because no indication in the text is made that other pterosaurs were thought by paleontologists to be comfortable walking.

New Zealand were largely consistent from 1903 to 1918. | C. Australia increased steadily from 1903 to 1918. | D. Turkey declined substantially from 1913 to 1918.,A,"Choice A is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the example. According to the graph, fewer than 10,000 sewing machines were sold in the Philippines in both 1903 and 1908, but nearly 30,000 were sold in 1913 and around 45,000 were sold in 1918. This increase illustrates the statement in the text that demand for Singer sewing machines grew significantly in the early twentieth century in overseas countries other than Russia, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Choice B is incorrect because consistent sales of Singer sewing machines in New Zealand from 1903 to 1918 do not indicate that demand for the product increased but rather that demand remained relatively the same. Choice C is incorrect because it does not accurately describe the data in the graph. Although sales in Australia did increase somewhat between 1903 and 1908, there was very little change between 1908 and 1913, and then sales declined between 1913 and 1918. The data for Australia, then, do not show a steady increase from 1903 to 1918. Choice D is incorrect because declining sales of Singer sewing machines in Turkey from 1913 to 1918 do not point to an increase in demand for the product but rather to a decline in demand."

The text explains that early in Earth’s history, Earth exhibited a stagnant lid regime in which there’s no interaction between the lithosphere and the underlying mantle. The text further explains that, by contrast, once Earth began to exhibit a tectonic plate regime, its lithospheric and mantle material began to mix. If mantle-derived rocks younger than 3.2 billion years contain material not found in older mantle-derived rocks, that material must have originated somewhere other than the mantle. And if this material is found in both older and contemporaneous lithospheric rocks, that would imply that the lithosphere was able to mix with mantle material beginning around 3.2 billion years ago, as the researchers concluded. Choice A is incorrect. The text gives no basis for comparing the quantities of lithospheric and mantle-derived rocks. Choice B is incorrect. The text gives no basis for comparing the material makeup of lithospheric rocks to that of mantle-derived rocks. Choice C is incorrect. A positive correlation between the age of lithospheric rocks and these rocks’ chemical similarity to mantle-derived rocks would mean that the oldest rocks would be the most similar, which contradicts the text’s claim that lithospheric and mantle-derived rocks were completely separate until 3.2 billion years ago. If the researchers’ conclusion about the onset of tectonics on Earth is correct, then younger lithospheric rocks would show greater chemical similarity to mantle-derived rocks than older lithospheric rocks do."

Woods in 1995 . The story of Hans Castorp that we intend to tell here—not for his sake (for the reader will come to know him as a perfectly ordinary, if engaging young man), but for the sake of the story itself, which seems to us to be very much worth telling (although in Hans Castorp’s favor it should be noted that it is his story, and that not every story happens to everybody)—is a story that took place long ago, and is, so to speak, covered with the patina of history and must necessarily be told with verbs whose tense is that of the deepest past. © 1995 by Alfred A.

Like all stories about the lives of inconsequential people, this story must necessarily be related in a particular way if the reason the story is consequential is to be made evident to the audience. | D. It is a remarkable story that happened to an unremarkable person, though one could plausibly argue that because the story is valuable, some of its value accrues to the person at its center.",D,"Choice D is the best answer because it presents a statement about Hans Castorp’s story that is suggested by the text. The narrator of the text indicates that the story about Hans Castorp will be told not because there is something particularly notable about him, since he is pleasant but ""perfectly ordinary,"" but because the story itself is remarkable (""very much worth telling""). The narrator then notes that there is a benefit in being at the heart of the story—that it is ""in Hans Castorp’s favor"" that the story is his, and maybe uniquely so (""not every story happens to everybody""). Thus, the text suggests both that the story that will be told is a remarkable one that happened to an unremarkable person and that it is reasonable to argue that the person at the center of a valuable story takes on some of the story’s value. Choice A is incorrect. Although the narrator of the text makes the point that ""not every story happens to everybody,"" the narrator doesn’t state that stories are interesting simply because the people they are about are unique. Rather, the narrator suggests that one particular story is ""very much worth telling"" on its own and that Hans Castorp benefits from the fact that the story is remarkable and may be unique to him. Further, the narrator never suggests that the story will be hard to understand even though it is old. Choice B is incorrect. Although the narrator of the text suggests that Hans Castorp is of no particular importance, since he is a ""perfectly ordinary"" person, the narrator never reveals what makes the story of Castorp important, just that ""the story itself"" is ""very much worth telling."" The narrator states that the story ""took place long ago,"" is ""covered with the patina of history,"" and can be told only ""with verbs whose tense is that of the deepest past,"" but the story’s age and the way it must be told aren’t presented as reasons the story is important; the narrator is simply providing details about how the story will be told. Choice C is incorrect because the narrator of the text doesn’t suggest that all stories about people who are ""perfectly ordinary"" (like Hans Castorp) must be told in particular ways to make it clear why those stories are consequential. Further, the narrator suggests that Hans Castorp’s story must be told ""with verbs whose tense is that of the deepest past"" because it took place so long ago, not because telling it that way will convey the story’s importance."

The text states that the writing system used in the Maya kingdoms had a symbol for the number zero. It goes on to say that at the time of the zero symbol’s earliest example, more than 2,000 years ago, almost no other writing systems in the world featured such a symbol. The text also points out that some historians suggest that Maya mathematicians inherited the use of zero from the Olmec civilization, which existed in the same area as the Maya civilization at an earlier date. Thus, according to the text, some historians suggest that the Maya civilization acquired the use of zero from the Olmec civilization.

In this quotation, Dr. Proudie is described as ""fondly flatter[ing] himself"" that he has gifts that ""must be sure to recommend him to a yet higher notice."" In other words, he expects his skills to push him to greater fame and success. This implies an exaggerated sense of his own abilities, which matches the claim we’re trying to support. Choice A is incorrect. This quotation doesn’t describe Proudie’s view of himself, nor does it paint him in an especially flattering light. Instead, by saying his mental powers and business skill are not ""proved,"" it implies that he is actually dim-witted and bad at business. Choice C is incorrect. This choice describes Proudie’s closeness to power and importance, but it doesn’t show what Proudie thinks of himself. Proudie is not describing himself or his abilities here. The narrator is. Choice D is incorrect. While this quotation offers Proudie very mild praise, it doesn’t show what Proudie thinks of himself or his own abilities, which is what the claim focuses on."

We should instead consider that in 1974, the art establishment’s recognition of Chicano artists was (and had long been) restricted to sociohistorical muralists, leaving nonmuralist Chicano artists—like Asco’s members—struggling to even exhibit their work; attending to this context opens an interpretation that accounts for all the evidence, allowing us to conclude that ______ blank",Which choice most logically completes the text?,"A. while Valdez’s presence in Instant Mural represents the social constraints placed on women at the time, Sandoval’s presence represents Chicano muralists’ frustration at their lack of recognition by the art establishment. | B. the main subject of Instant Mural is female Chicano artists’ experience of being doubly constrained by gender-role expectations and the marginalization of certain types of art. | C.

Instant Mural is best understood not as a critique of the social constraints placed on women but rather as a critique of sociohistorical muralists’ depictions of Chicano culture.",C,"Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Instant Mural . According to the text, the 1974 work Instant Mural involved taping two Asco members (Patssi Valdez and Humberto Sandoval) to an outdoor wall as a direct commentary on constraint (limitation or restriction). The text suggests that instead of focusing on Valdez’s role in the work and on social limitations women faced at the time—an approach that fails to explain the role of Sandoval, a man—people should consider that in 1974 (and long before) the art establishment limited recognition of Chicano artists to those who created murals with social and historical subjects, making it challenging for nonmuralist Chicano artists (such as Asco’s members) to show their work. The text suggests that considering the situation with the art establishment leads to a conclusion that accounts for the fact that Instant Mural is explicitly about constraint and features both a woman and a man taped to the wall: Instant Mural isn’t a reflection of the social constraints placed on women specifically but instead is a reflection on the constraining aesthetic expectations placed on Chicano artists in general (that is, the limits resulting from the lack of recognition of Chicano artists of any gender who did not create sociohistorical murals). Choice A is incorrect. The text indicates that the art establishment in 1974 (and earlier) did recognize Chicano muralists to the exclusion of other Chicano artists, so there’s no reason to assume Asco’s work Instant Mural was intended to represent Chicano muralists’ frustration; it’s far more likely that Asco’s members—described as Chicano nonmuralists—were representing their own frustration at being unrecognized by the art establishment. Choice B is incorrect. The text emphasizes that while a common approach to Instant Mural focuses on Valdez and the social limitations women faced in 1974 but fails to account for the presence of a man in the work, there is a conclusion that explains Sandoval’s role. But concluding that Instant Mural represents a double constraint experienced specifically by female Chicano artists would still fail to account for the inclusion of a man in the work. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text suggests that Instant Mural can be understood as something other than a commentary on social constraints women faced in 1974, it doesn’t suggest that the work is best understood as a critique of the content of any other artworks. The text doesn’t address how Chicano culture is depicted in sociohistorical murals; it discusses such murals only to make the point that in 1974 (and earlier) the art establishment recognized Chicano artists who produced them to the exclusion of Chicano nonmuralists, indicating a constraint all of Asco’s members faced, regardless of gender."

The text explains that the remains of a 4,000-year-old board game were found in Oman. The text then states that scholars claim this board game was played mostly by traders. If the other known examples of this board game from the same time period were discovered along routes that seem to have been used primarily by traders, this finding would directly support the scholars’ claim because it suggests that the game was largely played by traders who brought it with them for entertainment as they traveled.

Choice B is incorrect because this quotation indicates only that Joanna has a preference for her father, without giving a reason for that preference; therefore, it doesn’t illustrate the claim that Joanna cares only about others’ ambition. Choice C is incorrect because this quotation doesn’t illustrate that Joanna greatly admires the quality of ambition in others; it refers to Joanna’s similarity to her father ""so far as ambition was concerned"" but doesn’t reveal how she (or her father) views that quality. Choice D is incorrect because this quotation describes qualities Joanna possesses—praising her logic, concentration, and memory—instead of Joanna’s interest in other people’s qualities."

The text describes a study examining the relationship between a species of parasitic tapeworm, A. brevis , and its host insect, the T. nylanderi ant. According to the text, researchers were surprised to find that the tapeworm extends the life of its ant host, rather than reducing it. The text goes on to state that the infected ants end up doing less work to sustain the colony and that as a result, the uninfected ants take on the infected ants’ share of labor in addition to caring for them in their infected state. The study’s researchers also observed that the uninfected ants have shorter lifespans than expected. If the infected ants, who are doing less work in the colony, have longer lifespans, it can be inferred that the less an ant works, the longer it will live. The opposite of this statement can also be inferred: the more an ant works, the shorter its life. So, since the workload within the colony is being redistributed so that the infected ants work less while the uninfected ants work more (as they take on the neglected duties of the infected ants and also care for those ants), then it can be inferred that the lifespans of the uninfected ants are shortened because the need to compensate for reduced contributions within the colony while also caring for infected workers is burdensome to the uninfected workers. Choice A is incorrect because the text does not indicate how A. brevis is transmitted to the ants or assert that uninfected ants are more likely to be directly exposed to A. brevis while caring for infected ants. Choice C is incorrect because the text makes no mention of the relative abilities of infected and uninfected ants to escape predators: in fact, predators are not mentioned in the text at all. Choice D is incorrect because the text does not supply any information about the average lifespans of the ants in colonies without parasitic activity; the text only indicates factors that lengthen and shorten the lifespans of ants in parasitized colonies."

The researchers predicted that the students’ positive early experiences with the Anishinaabe language would lead them to be more likely to later share the language with younger generations. If former students maintain full fluency and cultural pride after finishing secondary and higher education, it follows that they would be both able and motivated to share what they know with others; this would likely result in a higher probability of transmitting the language to younger generations, as the researchers predict.

The researchers then hypothesized that a high level of cognitive engagement with ad content would result in a high level of ad recall, or memory of ad content.

Near Vancouver Island in Canada, the otter population is large and well established, yet the eelgrass meadows are healthier than those found elsewhere off Canada’s coast. To explain this, conservation scientist Erin Foster and colleagues compared the Vancouver Island meadows to meadows where otters are absent or were reintroduced only recently. Finding that the Vancouver Island meadows have a more diverse gene pool than the others do, Foster hypothesized that damage to eelgrass roots increases the plant’s rate of sexual reproduction; this, in turn, boosts genetic diversity, which benefits the meadows’ health overall.","Which finding, if true, would most directly undermine Foster’s hypothesis?","A.

At several sites not included in the study, eelgrass meadows’ health correlates negatively with the length of residence and size of otter populations. | D. At some sites in the study, the health of plants unrelated to eelgrass correlates negatively with the length of residence and size of otter populations.",C,"Choice C is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would weaken Foster’s hypothesis that damage to eelgrass roots improves the health of eelgrass meadows by boosting genetic diversity. The text indicates that sea otters damage eelgrass roots but that eelgrass meadows near Vancouver Island, where there’s a large otter population, are comparatively healthy. When Foster and her colleagues compared the Vancouver Island eelgrass meadows to those that don’t have established otter populations, the researchers found that the Vancouver Island meadows are more genetically diverse than the other meadows are. This finding led Foster to hypothesize that damage to the eelgrass roots encourages eelgrass reproduction, thereby improving genetic diversity and the health of the meadows. If, however, other meadows not included in the study are less healthy the larger the local otter population is and the longer the otters have been in residence, that would suggest that damage to the eelgrass roots, which would be expected to increase with the size and residential duration of the otter population, isn’t leading meadows to be healthier. Such a finding would therefore weaken Foster’s hypothesis. Choice A is incorrect because finding that small, recently introduced otter populations are near other eelgrass meadows in the study wouldn’t weaken Foster’s hypothesis. If otter populations were small and only recently established, they wouldn’t be expected to have caused much damage to eelgrass roots, so even if those eelgrass meadows were less healthy than the Vancouver Island meadows, that wouldn’t undermine Foster’s hypothesis. In fact, it would be consistent with Foster’s hypothesis since it would suggest that the greater damage caused by larger, more established otter populations is associated with healthier meadows. Choice B is incorrect because the existence of areas with otters but without eelgrass meadows wouldn’t reveal anything about whether the damage that otters cause to eelgrass roots ultimately benefits eelgrass meadows. Choice D is incorrect because the health of plants other than eelgrass would have no bearing on Foster’s hypothesis that damage to eelgrass roots leads to greater genetic diversity and meadow health. It would be possible for otters to have a negative effect on other plants while nevertheless improving the health of eelgrass meadows by damaging eelgrass roots."

Hexagonal cells for eggs that develop into nonreproductive workers are smaller than those for eggs that develop into reproductive drones, though the size difference varies by species. Difference in cell size results in a construction problem—it’s hard to neatly connect sections of small cells to sections of large cells—that worsens as the difference increases.

The text explains that in the hives of honeybees, the hexagonal cells housing drone eggs are larger than the hexagonal cells housing worker eggs, and that this size difference results in a construction problem that the bees address by using nonhexagonal cells to fill gaps between sections of drone-egg cells and worker-egg cells. The text also states that the size difference between drone-egg cells and worker-egg cells varies by species of honeybee. The graph displays data on the percentage of nonhexagonal cells in the hives of three species. In the hives of the western honeybee, the percentages of five-sided, seven-sided, and eight-sided cells are all less than 0.5%. But in the hives of the black dwarf honeybee, the percentages of five-sided and seven-sided cells are higher than those for the western honeybee: about 2.5% for both. And for the dwarf honeybee, the percentages of five-sided and seven-sided cells are also higher than those for the western honeybee: slightly over 2.5% and slightly over 2.0%, respectively; additionally, the dwarf honeybee possesses a higher percentage of eight-sided cells than the western honeybee does. Taken altogether, the graph shows that the hives of the western honeybee consist of a smaller percentage of nonhexagonal cells than the hives of the two other species do. Since the nonhexagonal cells exist only to solve the construction problem arising from the difference in size between drone-egg cells and worker-egg cells, a smaller percentage of nonhexagonal cells would be associated with a smaller size difference between the two types of cells. Therefore, it can be concluded from the data that worker-egg cells are probably closer in size to drone-egg cells in the hives of the western honeybee than in the hives of the other two species. Choice B is incorrect because, as the text states, honeybee species deposit their eggs in hexagonal cells, not in nonhexagonal ones. Thus, the western honeybee and black dwarf honeybee wouldn’t deposit drone eggs in eight-sided cells, and the dwarf honeybee wouldn’t deposit drone eggs in seven-sided cells. Choice C is incorrect. The text explains that honeybees rely mainly on one geometric shape, the hexagon, when constructing their hives, and the graph shows that the western honeybee relies on the same nonhexagonal shapes as the dwarf honeybee does: five-sided, seven-sided, and eight-sided cells. In other words, the western honeybee and dwarf honeybee rely on the same number of geometric shapes. For the black dwarf honeybee, the graph displays data only for five-sided and seven-sided cells, which suggests a total absence of eight-sided cells. Yet this would be only one less nonhexagonal shape than is seen in the western honeybee. Thus, based on the graph, it would be inaccurate to say that the western honeybee relies on ""many more"" geometrical shapes than the other two species do. Choice D is incorrect. As the text explains, honeybee hives consist mainly of hexagonal cells, and sections of nonhexagonal cells are used to connect sections of hexagonal cells of different sizes. Since the graph indicates that the percentage of nonhexagonal cells is lower for the western honeybee than it is for the dwarf honeybee or black dwarf honeybee, the western honeybee would conversely have a higher percentage of hexagonal cells than the either the dwarf honeybee or black dwarf honeybee does, not a lower percentage."

The text mentions a dialect of Spanish spoken in New Mexico, which was colonized by Spain in the 1600s. The text then states that the New Mexican dialect differs greatly from other Spanish dialects in that it still has characteristics of an older Spanish that other dialects eventually lost. After asking why this might be, the text points out that the New Mexico colony was distant from Spain’s other colonies, making it less attractive to colonists after the initial colonization. This geographic isolation limited the colony’s exposure to other Spanish colonists who would have otherwise introduced the changes to the Spanish language that occurred in their respective colonies. It can therefore be inferred that this isolation is a reason why the New Mexican dialect still has characteristics of an older Spanish, while the Spanish dialects spoken in less isolated areas that have more interaction with speakers of other dialects would lose those characteristics over time.

The text indicates that HILDA is a longitudinal study—it involves repeated observations over a long time—and that the ""need for years of data collection"" is what causes it and most other longitudinal studies to have high costs. The text then contrasts such studies with more straightforward studies, using the example of a fitness study that wants only to find out how many regular exercisers in a particular location do weight training, that may not demand a large budget.

Choice A is incorrect because the text explicitly introduces the idea of a less expensive, straightforward fitness study as a contrast to many longitudinal studies that, like HILDA, have high costs because they require data collection over many years. The fitness study is described as trying merely to gather information about a current behavior (how many regular exercisers do weight training) rather than track trends over time, which suggests that costs could remain low because expensive longitudinal methods would not be needed, not because they would be suitable. Choice B is incorrect because the idea that HILDA researchers could easily add questions to their study might be relevant to the costs of that survey but would be completely irrelevant as an explanation for why an unrelated fitness study may not need a large budget; the studies have no direct bearing on each other. Choice C is incorrect because the idea that HILDA involves more people than necessary would be relevant to the costs of that survey but would be completely irrelevant as an explanation for why an unrelated fitness study may not need a large budget; the studies have no direct bearing on each other."

The text tells us that the black-furred wolves are more common in areas with regular outbreaks of distemper virus and are more likely to be immune to distemper than the gray-furred wolves. This suggests that the gene variant that results in black fur may be linked to immunity to the distemper virus. Choice A is incorrect. The text never compares North American gray wolves to other wolf species—in fact, it never discusses other wolf species at all, so there’s no basis for this inference. Choice C is incorrect. The life span of gray wolves is never mentioned in this text, so we have no basis for this inference. Choice D is incorrect. This is too extreme.

The text explains that plant specialists are working to develop shorter corn varieties in an effort to improve yields. The text points out that although greater height in corn plants can lead to more ears of corn per plant, it also makes the stalks more likely to be damaged by strong winds before there is a chance to harvest the corn. This presents a clear trade-off between potential yield (taller plants producing more ears per plant) and harvest reliability (shorter plants surviving until harvest time). Given this information, it is reasonable to infer that shorter corn varieties, while possibly producing fewer ears per plant, would be more likely to survive until harvest time. This survival advantage would result in improved yields of harvested corn because more plants would remain intact, thus offsetting the potential reduction in ears per shorter plant. Choice B is incorrect. According to the text, greater height makes cornstalks vulnerable to snapping or being uprooted in strong winds, implying that taller plants—not shorter ones—have greater stability problems. The text provides no basis for inferring that shorter corn varieties would be more likely to be uprooted due to corn weight; in fact, the text suggests the opposite relationship between height and stability. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t provide information about the land requirements of either shorter corn varieties or shorter wheat and rice varieties, much less make any comparisons. The text mentions that plant breeders in the 1950s and ’60s created shorter varieties of wheat and rice with improved yields and that researchers are now exploring shorter corn varieties, but it doesn’t compare land-use requirements of these crops. Choice D is incorrect because the idea that shorter cornstalks would yield more ears of corn would contradict the relationship between height and corn production described in the text. The text explicitly states that greater height allows individual plants to produce more ears of corn, which suggests that shorter varieties would produce fewer ears per plant, not more. The text therefore provides no basis for concluding that shorter varieties would begin developing more ears than the taller varieties currently do."

If it were true both that Kuulo Kataa was founded in the fourteenth century CE and that artifacts found in excavations of the settlement are from the thirteenth century CE, it would be reasonable to conclude that the artifacts weren’t created in the Kuulo Kataa settlement. That would suggest, then, that the artifacts originated somewhere else and eventually reached the settlement through trading or as people migrated. Choice A is incorrect because the existence of thirteenth-century CE artifacts recovered during excavations of a settlement founded in the fourteenth century CE isn’t logically connected to artifacts from one century being more commonly recovered than artifacts from another century. Rather than suggesting anything about how frequently artifacts from different times are found, the existence of artifacts confirmed as predating the settlement’s founding suggests that those items arrived in Kuulo Kataa during or after its establishment. Choice C is incorrect because the text focuses on time periods and says nothing about which region the founders of Kuulo Kataa have been thought to come from; similarly, the text doesn’t suggest anything about where the thirteenth-century CE artifacts originated other than not from Kuulo Kataa. Therefore, it isn’t logical to conclude that the mere existence of artifacts confirmed as predating the Kuulo Kataa settlement suggests that the founders of the settlement came from a particular region other than one previously assumed. Choice D is incorrect because the existence of artifacts from the thirteenth century CE at a site dated to the fourteenth century CE doesn’t imply that fourteenth-century objects were damaged during excavations. There’s nothing in the text to suggest that any objects were damaged; rather, the existence of artifacts confirmed as predating the settlement’s founding suggests that those items were brought to Kuulo Kataa during or after its establishment."

The text explains that mycorrhizal hosts are plants that benefit from the presence of mycorrhizal fungi in the soil and that some such plants produce more mass when grown in the presence of these fungi, while for nonmycorrhizal species the fungi either have no effect or may be harmful. The experiment included two mycorrhizal hosts (corn and marigold) and one nonmycorrhizal species (broccoli). Given the claim in the text that nonmycorrhizal species will see either no difference or a decrease in mass when exposed to mycorrhizal fungi, the student would likely have been surprised by the higher average mass for broccoli grown in the presence of the fungi than the broccoli grown in the soil treated to kill fungi. Choice B is incorrect. Although this choice accurately describes the corn data from the table, the fact that the mycorrhizal host corn is more massive in the presence of the fungi likely fits with what the student expected and would therefore not be surprising. Choice C is incorrect. Although this choice accurately describes the marigold data from the table, the fact that the mycorrhizal host marigold is more massive in the presence of the fungi is likely what the student expected and thus would not be surprising. Choice D is incorrect because it does not accurately represent the data in the table—when grown in soil treated to kill fungi, corn had an average mass of 3.8 g while broccoli had an average mass of 7g—and because making comparisons among the plants in the no-fungi condition, by itself, does not provide a basis to compare the average mass of mycorrhizal hosts and nonmycorrhizal species grown in the presence of the fungi with those grown in the soil treated to kill fungi."

The text states that Indigenous cultures possess special knowledge of the medicinal uses of plants, which is reflected in their vocabulary. The text then discusses how tribal nations are working to preserve their languages, whose daily use is declining as globally dominant languages become increasingly dominant in Indigenous communities. Given that the languages of tribal nations in what is now the United States function as repositories of knowledge about plants’ medicinal uses, it logically follows that continued use of those languages will assist with passing on knowledge about the medicinal value of plants native to the tribal nations’ lands. Choice A is incorrect because the text states that preserving Indigenous languages will increase the knowledge, not the number, of medicinal plants. Choice B is incorrect because the text is concerned with how vocabulary about the medicinal value of plants can be preserved through the continued daily use of Indigenous languages, not with how such vocabulary can be incorporated into globally dominant, non-Indigenous languages. Moreover, the text explains that the exclusive use of globally dominant languages in Indigenous communities comes at an expense to the continued daily use of those communities’ languages.

The text indicates that while some scholars have believed that the map was drawn in the mid-1400s, the 2021 analysis showed the presence of the compound titanium dioxide in the ink used to draw the map. The text goes on to say that titanium dioxide wasn’t used to manufacture ink until the early 1900s, which means that ink containing this compound couldn’t have been available to mapmakers in the 1400s. Since mapmakers in the mid-1400s couldn’t have used ink with titanium dioxide, it follows that the Vinland Map couldn’t have been drawn by mid-1400s mapmakers. Choice A is incorrect because the 2021 finding that the ink used to draw the Vinland Map wasn’t available until the early 1900s doesn’t imply that Europeans in the mid-1400s couldn’t have known about the eastern coast of North America. While this finding suggests that the map couldn’t have been created in the mid-1400s, it doesn’t preclude the possibility that Europeans nevertheless had knowledge—and perhaps even drew other maps that are no longer in existence or are yet to be discovered by researchers—of the eastern coast of present-day North America as early as the mid-1400s. Choice C is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text that suggests that the 2021 discovery of the presence of titanium dioxide in the ink used to draw the Vinland Map caused Lemay, Zyats, and Bezur to question or reach a new conclusion about when mapmakers began using ink containing titanium compounds. Instead, the text indicates that titanium dioxide wasn’t used in ink before the early 1900s. This knowledge led the team to conclude that the map, which was drawn with ink containing titanium dioxide, couldn’t have been created in the mid-1400s. Choice D is incorrect because although the text doesn’t indicate that Lemay, Zyats, and Bezur established an exact date for the creation of the ink that was used to draw the Vinland Map, the text does say that titanium dioxide was introduced in ink manufacturing in the early 1900s. This fact provides enough information to determine that the ink that was used to draw the map was created no earlier than the early 1900s.

The narrator notes that Lutie thinks the street looks nice in the light of the sunset. The narrator goes on to describe what Lutie can see in the street: children playing ball or tag and girls skipping rope. Thus, what is happening in the text is that Lutie is observing the appearance of the street at a particular time of day and the events occurring on it. Choice B is incorrect. Although Lutie is observing children playing games on her street, the text doesn’t suggest that she is annoyed by the noise of the games. Instead, the text says that Lutie thinks the street looks nice in the light of the sunset. Choice C is incorrect. Although Lutie is observing children playing games on her street, the text doesn’t suggest that she is puzzled by the rules of the games. Choice D is incorrect because there is no evidence in the text that Lutie doesn’t want to interact with her neighbors or that she is in her apartment alone.

According to the text, Sam K. Hui and colleagues found that rearranging a store’s layout can encourage customers to make spontaneous purchases. The text states that the researchers explain that a change in layout causes shoppers to hunt for items’ new locations, which exposes the shoppers to more products and increases the likelihood that they’ll make an unplanned purchase. This quotation from a surveyed shopper indicates that the shopper spontaneously purchased a notebook while looking for cleaning supplies that weren’t in their usual place.

Finding that the venom used by the Panamanian scorpion Centruroides granosus to subdue prey also inhibits growth of the pathogenic bacteria Escherichia coli , Dumas Gálvez and colleagues conclude that the particular form of venom production observed in C. granosus may have propagated through the species because it mitigates risk during feeding in addition to enhancing predation success.","Which finding, if true, would most directly support Gálvez and colleagues’ conclusion?",A.

Exposure to C. granosus venom also inhibits the growth of nonpathogenic bacteria species common in the native environment of C. granosus .,B,"Choice B is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most directly support Dumas Gálvez and colleagues’ conclusion that the venom produced by the scorpion species Centruroides granosus helps mitigate, or reduce, risk during feeding in addition to enhancing predation success. According to the text, Gálvez and colleagues found that the venom used by C. granosus both subdues prey and inhibits the growth of Escherichia coli , a pathogen that, if ingested by C. granosus , would presumably cause disease unless neutralized in some way. If it were true that E. coli is commonly found in species preyed on by C. granosus and, moreover, can withstand C. granosus ’s digestive juices after ingestion, this would suggest that C. granosus likely relies on another mechanism to neutralize E. coli to make E. coli -infected prey safe for consumption by the scorpion species. Given that, as the text states, C. granosus ’s venom was found to inhibit the pathogen’s growth, it therefore follows that the venom provides protection for C. granosus against E. coli that its digestive system wouldn’t otherwise provide, making it reasonable to conclude that the trait may have spread through the species because it mitigates risk during feeding. Choice A is incorrect because a finding that E. coli doesn’t appear to be virulent, or dangerous, for C. granosus even when venom isn’t used would weaken rather than strengthen Gálvez and colleagues’ conclusion that a particular form of venom production spread in C. granosus in part because it helps reduce risk during feeing, since this finding would suggest that E. coli isn’t actually a risk to C. granosus when consuming prey. Choice C is incorrect because a finding that C. granosus can detect and avoid consuming E. coli -infected prey in the first place would suggest that an ability other than venom production is the primary factor that reduces C. granosus ’s risk when feeding, which would suggest there has been less evolutionary pressure to develop venom that provides protection; thus, this finding wouldn’t clearly support the conclusion that C. granosus ’s form of venom production spread in the species in part because it helps reduce risk during feeding. Choice D is incorrect because Gálvez and colleagues’ conclusion focuses on C. granosus venom in relation to the risk of E. coli , and a finding that the venom also inhibits nonpathogenic (not disease-causing) bacteria species, which presumably don’t pose a risk if consumed, wouldn’t be relevant to the conclusion that C. granosus ’s particular form of venom production spread in the species in part because it helps reduce risk during feeding."

To investigate swing, a team led by physicist Corentin Nelias delayed the downbeats and synchronized the offbeats in jazz piano solos and asked jazz musicians to compare the intensity of swing in each modified piece with the intensity of swing in the original piece.

The passage tells us that participants were “more than seven times likelier to characterize the modified songs as having swing than to characterize the original versions as having swing.” Because the modified songs had been changed by altering the timing of the downbeats and offbeats, this suggests that the timing of downbeats and offbeats may play a crucial role in giving a song swing. Choice A is incorrect. Although the passage mentions that the researchers “synchronized the offbeats” in the modified songs, they also “delayed the downbeats” in those songs. Because we can’t disentangle whether it was the synchronized offbeats, the delayed downbeats, or the combination of both that increased the song’s swing, we don’t have enough information to make this inference.

The table lists the observatories where these instruments are housed, the type of data each instrument collected (infrared imaging or spectroscopy), and the years in which the instruments’ observations were made. According to the table, only two of these instruments obtained spectroscopy data: VISIR at the European Southern Observatory, which made its observations in 2006, and TEXES at the Gemini Observatory, which made its observations in later years (2007 and 2019). Although two other instruments are also included in the table, they obtained infrared imaging data, not spectroscopy data.

Although the table indicates that TEXES at the Gemini Observatory collected spectroscopy data in 2007 and 2019, the table also indicates that this type of data was collected in 2006 by VISIR at the European Southern Observatory.

The graph shows the ratio of manganese to calcium in L. pertusa coral samples from the Alboran Sea and the Mauritanian coast. The graph reflects time in approximate years before present: in other words, the greater the number in years noted on the graph’s horizontal axis, the farther that moment is in the past. The text indicates that the researchers tested the samples to determine whether oxygenation played a role in the decline of L. pertusa . The text goes on to note that a change in the ratio of manganese to calcium would signal an inverse, or opposite, change in oxygenation. According to the graph, the ratio of manganese to calcium in samples from the Alboran Sea increased from about 30 micromoles per mole 10,000 years ago to about 80 micromoles per mole 8,000 years ago, which means that oxygenation decreased between 10,000 and 8,000 years ago. Meanwhile, there was almost no discernible change in the ratio of manganese to calcium in samples from the Mauritanian coast between 12,000 and 10,000 years ago. According to the text, the population of L. pertusa declined significantly around 9,000 years ago in the Alboran Sea and around 11,000 years ago near the Mauritanian coast. Thus, the increase in the ratio of manganese to calcium around 9,000 years ago in the Alboran Sea coincides with the decline in the L. pertusa population, suggesting an association between the decrease in oxygenation and the decline in population of the coral. No such relationship is suggested around 11,000 years ago near the Mauritanian coast. So, oxygenation likely played a role in the L. pertusa decline in the Alboran Sea but not in the coral’s decline near the Mauritanian coast. Choice A is incorrect because it asserts the opposite of what the graph indicates regarding oxygenation in the Alboran Sea, and it misrepresents what the graph indicates about oxygenation near the Mauritanian coast. The graph indicates that at the time of the decline in L. pertusa (approximately 9,000 years ago), the samples from the Alboran Sea contained a ratio of manganese to calcium that was increasing. According to the text, this ratio inversely correlates with ocean oxygenation levels, so if the ratio was increasing, oxygenation was decreasing, not substantially increasing. Furthermore, the graph shows that the ratio of manganese to calcium remained relatively stable in coral samples from the Mauritanian coast during the period studied, which suggests that there was no discernible relationship between oxygenation and the coral’s population decline in that location, not that there was a substantial decrease in oxygenation corresponding to the coral’s decline. Choice C is incorrect. Although the graph suggests that the level of oxygenation in the Alboran Sea was higher before the decline in L. pertusa than after—because the ratio of manganese to calcium inversely correlates with ocean oxygenation levels and this ratio was lower before the decline than after—the graph doesn’t support the claim that oxygenation near the Mauritanian coast was consistently low before and after the coral’s decline there. Rather, the graph indicates that relative to coral samples from the Alboran Sea, the ratio of manganese to calcium in samples from near the Mauritanian coast was consistently low, which suggests that oxygenation levels were relatively high both before and after the decline of L. pertusa . Choice D is incorrect because it states the opposite of what the graph indicates: the graph shows that throughout the period studied, the ratio of manganese to calcium was higher in coral samples from the Alboran Sea than it was in samples from near the Mauritanian coast. Since the text indicates that the ratio of manganese to calcium inversely correlates with ocean oxygenation levels, oxygenation in the Alboran Sea was therefore lower than, not higher than, oxygenation near the Mauritanian coast during the period studied. Moreover, even if choice D did accurately represent the graph, it wouldn’t effectively complete the statement since a comparison of the ocean oxygenation levels at the two locations is not relevant to the claim that a decline in oxygenation levels was associated with the decline of L. pertusa in the Alboran Sea but not near the Mauritanian coast."

Choice A is incorrect because it focuses on only one period of time (the early 1980s). Thus, the data it cites don’t support the researcher’s claim, which compares the duration of surface ice across two specific periods of time (the early 1980s and the mid-2000s). Choice B is incorrect because although it accurately describes data from the graph, it contradicts the researcher’s claim about declining surface ice duration. It describes an increase, not a decline, in the duration of surface ice on Lake Neusiedl between the early 1980s and the mid-2000s (from about 80 days in 1980–81 to about 100 days in 2005–06). Therefore, the example of Lake Neusiedl wouldn’t logically support the claim that some lakes have seen a decline in the duration of surface ice. Choice D is incorrect because it provides information that doesn’t support the researcher’s claim about declining ice duration. The graph could indicate that both Lake Neusiedl and Oulujärvi had more than 105 days of ice in the winter of 2005–06, but on its own, this information doesn’t demonstrate a decline in ice duration between the early 1980s and the mid-2000s."

Karenin is a dog that belongs to Tomas and Tereza. Karenin was not overjoyed by the move to Switzerland [from Prague]. Karenin hated change. Dog time cannot be plotted along a straight line; it does not move on and on, from one thing to the next. It moves in a circle like the hands of a clock, which—they, too, unwilling to dash madly ahead—turn round and round the face, day in and day out following the same path. In Prague, when Tomas and Tereza bought a new chair or moved a flower pot, Karenin would look on in displeasure. It disturbed his sense of time. It was as though they were trying to dupe the hands of the clock by changing the numbers on its face. ©1984 by Milan Kundera. Translation ©1984 by Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc.",Which choice best states the main idea of the text?,"A. As a dog, Karenin possesses a sense of time that involves a strong preference for predictability and an aversion to disruption. | B. After he’s moved to a new home, Karenin’s negative response to changes has become more pronounced. | C. Similar to Tomas and Tereza, Karenin comprehends time as circular rather than as a straightforward progression. | D. As is the case for other dogs, Karenin’s sense of time seems to accelerate depending on the objects and places that surround him.",A,"Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. The text begins by stating that Tomas and Tereza’s dog Karenin felt disrupted by a recent move because of his dislike of change. The text then goes on to suggest that this is because the way a dog experiences time differs from the way humans experience time: time for a dog doesn’t move linearly, going ""on and on, from one thing to the next,"" but instead moves circularly, ""like the hands of a clock."" That is, time for a dog is experienced as a cyclical pattern characterized by routine and predictability, with each day ""following the same path."" The text then concludes by providing examples of seemingly insignificant changes in routine that profoundly ""disturbed [Karenin’s] sense of time,"" causing him to feel displeasure. Thus, the main idea of the text is that Karenin’s sense of time as a dog involves a strong preference for predictability and an aversion to disruption. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text emphasizes Karenin’s displeasure with the recent move to a new home, it doesn’t suggest that the move has made his negative responses more pronounced than they once were. Rather, in accounting for Karenin’s displeasure with the move to Switzerland, the text explains that Karenin generally has a negative response to any kind of change. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that Karenin comprehends time similarly to how Tomas and Tereza comprehend it. On the contrary, the text strongly implies a contrast between dogs’ circular experience of time with the way humans experience time as a straightforward progression that can be ""plotted on a straight line."" Choice D is incorrect because the text provides no indication that a change in the places and objects surrounding Karenin causes him to feel as though time is accelerating. Although the text does use the language of ""dash[ing] madly ahead"" in relation to time, the phrase appears in the context of a comparison illustrating how dogs experience time: time for a dog moves just as the hands of a clock do, in a circle and ""unwilling to dash madly ahead""—that is, always in a regular and predictable way."

In a study of sediment sampled at more than a dozen sites in Alpine streams, however, geologists Camille Litty and Fritz Schlunegger found that cross-site variations in grain size were not associated with differences in downstream distance, though they did not conclude that downstream distance is irrelevant to grain size. Rather, they concluded that sediment influx in these streams may have been sufficiently spatially diffuse to prevent the typical sorting effect from being observed.","Which finding about the streams in the study, if true, would most directly support Litty and Schlunegger’s conclusion?","A. The streams regularly experience portions of their banks collapsing into the water at multiple points upstream of the sampling sites. | B. The streams contain several types of sediment that are not typically found in streams where the sorting effect has been demonstrated. | C. The streams mostly originate from the same source, but their lengths vary considerably due to the different courses they take. | D. The streams are fed by multiple tributaries that carry significant volumes of sediment and that enter the streams downstream of the sampling sites.",A,"Choice A is the best answer. This finding would support the conclusion. If stream banks are collapsing into the water at multiple points, then sediment is getting into the water at those various points. This supports the conclusion that the inflow of sediment is very spread out. Choice B is incorrect. This finding wouldn’t support the conclusion. The conclusion is about the influx of sediment being “spatially diffuse,” meaning spread out over a large area. The type of sediment wouldn’t have an impact on the conclusions. Choice C is incorrect. This finding wouldn’t support the conclusion. It doesn’t say anything about the influx of sediment being “spatially diffuse” (spread out). Choice D is incorrect. This finding wouldn’t support the conclusion. Any sediment that enters downstream of the sampling sites wouldn’t end up in the samples, so it wouldn’t affect the findings or the conclusion."

Researchers investigated the poor resistance tomato plants show to whitefly herbivory by exposing some plants to airborne chemicals from whitefly-free plants and others to airborne chemicals from whitefly-infested plants, then infesting both groups of plants with whiteflies.

When plants exposed to air from whitefly-infested plants were infested, they produced less jasmonic acid than did control plants, whereas when plants exposed to air from whitefly-free plants were infested, they produced more jasmonic acid and salicylic acid than did control plants.",A,"Choice A is the best answer because it best describes data from the graph that support the researchers’ conclusion about whitefly-induced defenses in tomato plants. According to the text, tomato plants produce airborne chemicals that prompt nearby tomato plants to increase their production of appropriate defensive chemicals, such as jasmonic acid in response to herbivory and salicylic acid in response to microbial infection. The text goes on to indicate that researchers concluded that whiteflies induce tomato plants to emit chemicals that cause nearby plants to defend against microbial infection instead of herbivory from whiteflies. The graph shows that control tomato plants (plants that weren’t exposed to any chemicals from nearby tomato plants and weren’t subsequently infested with whiteflies) produced about 140 nanograms of jasmonic acid per gram of dry weight and about 120 nanograms of salicylic acid per gram of dry weight, which indicates the baseline levels of these defensive chemicals in tomato plants. The graph also shows that plants exposed to air from whitefly-free plants produced about 205 nanograms of jasmonic acid per gram of dry weight when subsequently infested by whiteflies, which is more than the amount produced by the control plants. This suggests that when infested with whiteflies, tomato plants that weren’t previously exposed to air from nearby whitefly-infested plants begin producing higher levels of jasmonic acid to defend against the infestation. Finally, the graph also shows that plants exposed to air from whitefly-infested plants and then subsequently infested by whiteflies produced approximately 100 nanograms of jasmonic acid per gram of dry weight (which is less than control plants did) and approximately 175 nanograms of salicylic acid per gram of dry weight (which is more than control plants did). This suggests that whiteflies cause tomato plants to emit chemical signals that decrease nearby plants’ defenses against whitefly herbivory relative to baseline levels and redirect their defenses toward microbial infection, thereby supporting the researchers’ conclusion that whiteflies cause tomato plants to emit airborne chemical signals that induce nearby plants to preferentially defend against microbes even when experiencing herbivory from whiteflies. Choice B is incorrect. Although the graph shows that tomato plants exposed to whitefly-infested plants produced less jasmonic acid than salicylic acid (about 100 nanograms of jasmonic acid per gram of dry weight vs. about 175 nanograms of salicylic acid per gram of dry weight), and although this might suggest that those plants are therefore better defended against microbial attack than against herbivory, this wouldn’t be sufficient to conclude that this is the case: without reference to the relative levels of defensive chemicals produced by the plants in the other experimental conditions, it would be impossible to conclude that exposure to air from whitefly-infested plants either induces or diminishes these plants’ defenses to different kinds of threats. Furthermore, the graph shows that plants exposed to air from whitefly-free plants produced about 205 nanograms of jasmonic acid per gram of dry weight and about 130 nanograms of salicylic acid per gram of dry weight, not that they produced the same amount of the two acids. Choice C is incorrect because it inaccurately describes the data in the graph. The graph shows that plants in all three conditions produced both jasmonic and salicylic acid, not that plants exposed to air from whitefly-infested plants produce no jasmonic acid at all. Choice D is incorrect. Although the graph shows that plants exposed to air from whitefly-infested plants produced about 100 nanograms of jasmonic acid per gram of dry weight when infested, which is less than the amount produced by control plants (about 140 nanograms per gram of dry weight), and although the graph shows that plants exposed to air from whitefly-free plants produced about 205 nanograms of jasmonic acid per gram of dry weight when infested (which is more than the amount produced by control plants) and about 130 nanograms of salicylic acid per gram of dry weight (which is more than the approximately 120 nanograms per gram of dry weight produced by control plants), this wouldn’t support the researchers’ conclusion that plants exposed to air from whitefly-infested plants preferentially defend against microbial infection—that is, that they increase their levels of salicylic acid and decrease their levels of jasmonic acid relative to control plants. Rather, the data would suggest that exposure to air from whitefly-infested plants reduces plants’ defenses against herbivory, but these data wouldn’t indicate that whiteflies induce plants to redirect their defenses to guard against microbial infection. Furthermore, the data concerning plants exposed to air from whitefly-free plants merely indicate that these plants increase their defenses against both herbivory and microbial infection when infested by whiteflies."

Choice D is incorrect because the finding that subjects in both groups were more likely to have negative attitudes than positive attitudes toward the winning candidate two years after an election would reflect all subjects’ attitudes at one particular time whether they voted or not, rather than the presence or absence of a change in voters’ attitudes after voting. Therefore, the finding would neither weaken nor strengthen the claim that voting in an election doesn’t change a voter’s attitude toward the candidates."

Extreme high pressure, such as can be found in deep ocean waters, destabilizes these bonds and compresses water’s structure, allowing water molecules within organisms to permeate proteins and impede crucial biological functions; yet deep-sea organisms known as piezophiles have adapted to extreme pressure. Studies have found a positive correlation between the depths that various piezophiles inhabit and concentrations of a compound called trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) in their muscle tissues, which has led a team of researchers to hypothesize that TMAO reduces water’s compressibility.","Which finding, if true, would most directly support the researchers’ hypothesis?",A. Water molecules are found to be impervious to TMAO even when the water molecules’ tetrahedral configuration has been distorted by high pressure. | B. Examination of TMAO’s molecular structure shows that TMAO molecules retain their shape even as pressure increases. | C. A positive correlation is found between concentrations of TMAO and the rate at which water’s molecular structure compresses as pressure increases. | D. Analysis of water’s molecular structure under high pressure reveals that hydrogen bonds are more stable when TMAO is present than when it is not.,D,"Choice D is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would support the researchers’ hypothesis that TMAO reduces water’s compressibility. The text explains that at great depths in the ocean, extreme pressure compresses the molecular structure of water by destabilizing the hydrogen bonds between adjacent molecules, thereby allowing water to penetrate proteins and harm the associated organisms. However, deep-sea organisms called piezophiles have adapted to live at these depths and previous studies show a positive correlation between the depth at which a piezophile species lives and the species’ level of the compound TMAO. Because this hypothesis links TMAO levels with reduced compressibility of water’s tetrahedral molecular structure, a finding that TMAO helps maintain the hydrogen bonds between water molecules under high pressure would strongly support that hypothesis. Choice A is incorrect. Although the researchers’ hypothesis suggests a relationship between TMAO and water molecules’ tetrahedral molecular structure, that relationship involves TMAO helping maintain water’s tetrahedral molecular structure under high pressure; as presented in the text, the hypothesis doesn’t contend that water molecules are impervious to, or incapable of being penetrated by, TMAO. Choice B is incorrect because the text discusses how the molecular structure of water, not TMAO, is compressed under extreme pressure and never addresses how TMAO might be affected by such pressure. Choice C is incorrect because the researchers’ hypothesis holds that water under extreme pressure is more resistant, not less, to being compressed when TMAO concentrations are higher. Moreover, the positive correlation mentioned in the text is between TMAO concentrations and the depths at which piezophiles live, not between concentrations of TMAO and the rate at which water’s molecular structure compresses as pressure increases."

Consumption of eastern oysters by cownose rays in the region substantially increased before the regional decline in dusky shark abundance began. | D. Cownose rays have increased in regional abundance as dusky sharks have decreased in regional abundance.,D,"Choice D is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most directly support the researchers’ hypothesis about the connection between the dusky shark population decline and the eastern oyster population decline. The text indicates that although dusky sharks don’t usually eat eastern oysters, they do consume cownose rays, which are the main predators of eastern oysters. An increase in the abundance of cownose rays in the region in response to a decline in the abundance of dusky sharks would directly support the researchers’ hypothesis: a higher number of cownose rays would consume more eastern oysters, driving down the oyster population. Choice A is incorrect because a finding that there’s an association between a decline in the regional abundance of some of dusky sharks’ prey and the regional abundance of dusky sharks wouldn’t directly support the researchers’ hypothesis that a decline in dusky sharks has led to a decline in eastern oysters in the region. Although such a finding might help explain why shark abundance has declined, it would reveal nothing about whether the shark decline is related to the oyster decline. Choice B is incorrect because a finding that eastern oyster abundance tends to be greater when dusky sharks and cownose rays are present than when only dusky sharks are present wouldn’t support the researchers’ hypothesis that a decline in dusky sharks has led to a decline in eastern oysters in the region. The text indicates that the sharks prey on the rays, which are the main predators of the oysters; if oyster abundance is found to be greater when rays are present than when rays are absent, that would suggest that rays aren’t keeping oyster abundance down, and thus that a decline in rays’ predators, which would be expected to lead to an increase in the abundance of rays, wouldn’t bring about a decline in oyster abundance as the researchers hypothesize. Choice C is incorrect because a finding that consumption of eastern oysters by cownose rays increased substantially before dusky sharks declined in regional abundance wouldn’t support the researchers’ hypothesis that the decline in dusky sharks has led to a decline in eastern oysters in the region. Such a finding would suggest that some factor other than shark abundance led to an increase in rays’ consumption of oysters and thus to a decrease in oyster abundance, thereby weakening the researchers’ hypothesis."

In the quotation, Lear describes striking himself on the head—the same act he’s engaged in as he speaks, and one that suggests he’s deeply upset with himself. Referring to himself in the second person (with “thy”), the character exclaims “Beat at this gate that let thy folly in / And thy dear judgement out!” Lear refers metaphorically to his own mind as a gate that has allowed folly, or poor judgement, to enter and good judgement to escape. This suggests that Lear regrets his attempts to test his three daughters’ devotion to him, regarding those attempts as examples of the folly that has entered the gate of his mind. Choice A is incorrect because this quotation doesn’t express King Lear’s sense of regret over his own actions; instead, it expresses his belief that the harm that others have done to him (or the extent to which they have “sinned against” him) outweighs whatever harm he himself has caused by “sinning.” Choice B is incorrect because this quotation doesn’t express King Lear’s sense of regret over his own actions; instead, it expresses his thoughts about an approaching storm (“this tempest”), which he believes “will not give [him] leave to ponder,” or time to consider, the harm that he will continue to experience (“things” that “would hurt [him] more”).

The text describes a disagreement among scholars about whether Mexican-American folklore mostly derived from the folklore of Spain or originated in Mexico and the United States as cultures there have interacted. The latter view is the argument that Paredes puts forward. If Mexican-American folklore collected in the twentieth century mostly consists of ballads about history and social life that originated recently, then that would support Paredes’s argument, since it would suggest that the folklore mostly arose after Spanish rule ended in the early nineteenth century and that the folklore reflects cultural interactions in Mexico and the United States rather than traditions from Spain. Choice A is incorrect because the inclusion of songs influenced by sixteenth-century Spanish poetry among Mexican-American folklore collected in the twentieth century would not support Paredes’s view that the folklore was the result of cultural interactions in Mexico and the United States rather than an offshoot of Spanish folklore. If anything, the presence of such songs among the folklore collected in the twentieth century would weaken Paredes’s argument, since it would reflect the influence of Spanish culture on the folklore. Choice B is incorrect because the mere presence of similarities in Mexican-American folklore across regions would not be sufficient to draw a conclusion about where the folklore originated, let alone to support Paredes’s argument that the folklore reflects cultural interactions in Mexico and the United States.

Rather, the text states that some critics are concerned that the trees on Bosco Verticale’s balconies may not thrive in this setting. Choice C is incorrect because the text does not mention how Bosco Verticale was constructed, let alone how environmentally destructive its construction may have been relative to the construction of more conventional buildings."

One limitation of the cells, however, has to do with their electron transport layer (ETL), through which absorbed electrons must pass. Often the ETL is applied through a process called spin coating, but such ETLs are fairly inefficient at converting input power to output power. André Taylor and colleagues tested a novel spray coating method for applying the ETL. The team produced ETLs of various thicknesses and concluded that spray coating holds promise for improving the power conversion efficiency of ETLs in perovskite solar cells.",Which choice best describes data from the graph that support Taylor and colleagues’ conclusion?,"A.

The highest performing ETL applied through spray coating showed a power conversion efficiency of approximately 13%, while the highest performing ETL applied through spin coating showed a power conversion efficiency of approximately 11%. | D. There was a substantial difference in power conversion efficiency between the lowest and highest performing ETLs applied through spray coating.",B,"Choice B is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that support Taylor and colleagues’ conclusion that spray coating holds promise for improving the power conversion efficiency of ETLs in perovskite solar cells. The text explains that perovskite solar cells’ efficiency at converting light into electricity is diminished by their electron transport layer (ETL), which is applied through spin coating, but that Taylor’s team devised a new spray coating method for applying the ETL that improves its power conversion efficiency. The graph displays data on the power conversion efficiency of solar cells in tests conducted by Taylor’s team, with bars for both the highest- and lowest-performing ETLs in two data categories: spray coating and spin coating. According to the graph, the lowest-performing ETL applied through spray coating had a power conversion efficiency of between 14% and 16%, while the highest-performing ETL applied through spin coating had a power conversion efficiency of less than 14%. These data confirm that ETLs applied through novel spray coating are more efficient than those applied though traditional spin coating. Thus, the data support Taylor and colleagues’ conclusion about spray coating’s potential value. Choice A is incorrect. Although this claim correctly describes the data in the graph by stating that both the lowest-performing ETL applied through spin coating and the lowest-performing ETL applied through spray coating had a power conversion efficiency greater than 10%, this relationship in the data doesn’t support or relate to Taylor and colleagues’ conclusion that spray coating promises greater efficiency for solar cells than traditional spin coating does. Choice C is incorrect. This claim does address the greater power conversion efficiency of the highest-performing ETL applied through spray coating, compared with the highest-performing ETL applied through spin coating. However, it also incorrectly cites the value for the efficiency of the highest-performing ETL applied through spray coating as approximately 13%, instead of a value between 14% and 16%, and the value for the efficiency of the highest-performing ETL applied through spin coating as approximately 11%, instead of a value between 12% and 14%, as shown in the graph. Choice D is incorrect because Taylor and colleagues’ conclusion is based on the difference in the power conversion efficiency of ETLs applied through spray coating and that of ETLs applied through spin coating, not on the difference between the highest- and lowest-performing ETLs applied through just spray coating."

Such identification is heightened by “invisible editing,” or editing so inconspicuous that it renders cuts between shots almost unnoticeable. Conversely, Mulvey proposes that conspicuous editing or an absence of point-of-view shots would induce a more critical stance toward a protagonist.

We’re told that point-of-view shots and “invisible editing” make audiences identify with a character. We’re also told that obvious editing and a lack of point-of-view shots have the opposite effect. Since the sequence in The Birds falls into this second category, it should have the effect of reducing the audience’s connection with the protagonist. Choice A is incorrect. The passage doesn’t mention viewers’ awareness of artifice (i.e., camera trickery) in films, so there’s no basis for this inference. Choice C is incorrect.

The text indicates that some songs of the Kwakwaka’wakw people of Canada’s Pacific Northwest region document how the people used terraced gardens in intertidal zones to cultivate clams for food. The text also explains that archaeological evidence shows increases in ""clam size and abundance"" that occurred along with the implementation of this cultivation method, suggesting the method’s efficacy in not just supporting clam yields but also improving them. It follows, then, that the use of intertidal terraced gardens, as described in the songs, allowed the ancestors of modern Kwakwaka’wakw people to maintain clams as a food source and to cultivate larger and more numerous clams. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t mention anything about cultivation practices among non-Indigenous people in the Pacific Northwest coastal region. Though the text conveys that archaeological evidence suggests that the clam cultivation practice mentioned in Kwakwaka’wakw people’s songs was efficacious when implemented, it gives no indication that people other than the Kwakwaka’wakw adopted that practice. Choice C is incorrect because the text provides no information about the archaeological record as it pertains to Sakha and Kaluli songs and doesn’t suggest that there is less corroboration of practices described in those songs than there is of the clam cultivation practice described in Kwakwaka’wakw songs. The Sakha and Kaluli songs are mentioned early in the text only as examples of Indigenous songs that contain ecological knowledge. Choice D is incorrect because archaeological evidence that clam size and abundance both increased when Kwakwaka’wakw ancestors implemented intertidal terraced gardens provides information only about the past use of that method and doesn’t suggest anything about present practices. The text indicates that knowledge of a past clam cultivation method is maintained in Kwakwaka’wakw songs but doesn’t indicate whether modern Kwakwaka’wakw people use that or other fishing and farming practices used by their ancestors."

However, the text then points out that every novel is the singular result of a combination of the particular conditions surrounding its creation. This suggests that it isn’t possible to determine the effect of any single condition (such as the means of writing) on its own; thus, there would be no way to reasonably evaluate how a novel would have turned out differently if it had been written by other means.

The table shows the ablation rates for three elements—iron, potassium, and sodium—found in cosmic dust that comes from one of four sources. The text says that the ablation rate for a given element in slower-moving SPC and AST dust was lower than the ablation rate for that same element in faster-moving HTC or OCC dust. The text then presents the first part of an example of this pattern, describing an ablation rate of 28% for iron in AST dust. The information that iron from HTC dust had an ablation rate of 90% is therefore the most effective way to complete this example—the comparison of a relatively low ablation rate for iron in slower-moving AST dust with a relatively high ablation rate for iron in faster-moving HTC dust illustrates the tendency of ablation rates for a given element to be lower in slower-moving dust than in faster-moving dust. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that SPC dust, like AST dust, moves relatively slowly; a comparison of the ablation rates of iron from two slower-moving dust sources could not be an example of the difference between ablation rates in slower-moving dust and faster-moving dust, which is the pattern that the example is supposed to illustrate. Choice B is incorrect because the example in the text is supposed to illustrate the difference in the ablation rates of the same element from slower-moving dust and faster-moving dust, and the first part of the example provides data about the ablation rate of iron, which means the second part of the example must also be about the ablation rate of iron, not the ablation rate of sodium. Choice D is incorrect because the example in the text is supposed to illustrate the difference in the ablation rates of the same element from slower-moving dust and faster-moving dust, and the first part of the example provides data about the ablation rate of iron, which means the second part of the example must also be about the ablation rate of iron, not the ablation rate of sodium.

This choice accurately reflects that a longer whale (the fin whale) takes more time to filter engulfed water (31.30 seconds on average) compared to a shorter whale (the minke whale, which only took 8.88 seconds on average). Choice A is incorrect. The table shows that minke whales take an average of 8.88 seconds to filter engulfed water, while humpback whales take an average of 17.12 seconds to complete the same task. Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn’t reflect the claim about baleen plates. The claim explains why whales of differing lengths take different amounts of time to filter engulfed water. This choice doesn’t compare whales of different lengths, and it focuses on the number of lunges, which isn’t shown to be relevant to filter time. Choice D is incorrect. The table shows that blue whales average 4.02 lunges per dive, which is not the highest average among the whales in the table."

In recent decades, tadpoles in the Australian population have been shown to consume eggs of their own species. A 2022 study showed that when presented with cane toad eggs as well as eggs of native Australian amphibians, cane toad tadpoles disproportionately consumed eggs of their own species. This behavior results from their attraction to bufadienolide, a chemical produced by the eggs of cane toads but not by the eggs of native amphibians. However, using data from this study, a student wishes to argue that the presence of bufadienolide doesn’t entirely explain the cane toad tadpoles’ preference for certain eggs over others.",Which choice best describes data from the table that support the student’s argument?,"A.

For each of five amphibian species included in the 2022 study, the table gives the percentage of available eggs that the cane toad tadpoles ate. According to the table, the tadpoles ate 10% of striped burrowing frog eggs and 1% of dainty green tree frog eggs, which suggests a preference for striped burrowing frog eggs over dainty green tree frog eggs. The table also indicates that neither of these species’ eggs produces bufadienolide. Thus, these data suggest that something other than the presence or absence of bufadienolide is needed to adequately explain the tadpoles’ egg preferences. Choice B is incorrect. Although the table shows that for each of the five amphibian species, the cane toad tadpoles ate less than 100% of that species’ eggs, which demonstrates that the tadpoles did indeed leave some eggs for each species unharmed, this fact alone is irrelevant to the tadpoles’ preferences for some species’ eggs over other species’ eggs. Choice C is incorrect. Although the table indicates that the cane toad tadpoles ate 90% of the cane toad eggs and 7% of the short-footed frog eggs, which suggests that they prefer cane toad eggs over short-footed frog eggs, the table also indicates that cane toad eggs produce bufadienolide, whereas short-footed frog eggs do not. Therefore, these data are not sufficient to exclude that bufadienolide alone could explain the tadpoles’ preference for some species’ eggs over other species’ eggs. Choice D is incorrect. Although the table shows that for both dainty green tree frog eggs and little red tree frog eggs, the cane toad tadpoles ate 1% of those species’ eggs, it also indicates that neither produces bufadienolide. Thus, these data alone don’t indicate bufadienolide’s role in the tadpoles’ egg preferences."

The team detected BovB —a gene transmitted vertically in snakes—in many frog species.

The text focuses on formations of parallel ice ridges on Jupiter’s moon Europa that are said to be formed by the same mechanism that formed a parallel set of ridges on Greenland’s ice sheet.

In other words, the main idea of the text is that parallel ridges in the ice on Europa and Greenland are likely caused by similar processes even though in Greenland the process begins with liquid water on the surface while Europa lacks liquid water on the surface. Choice B is incorrect because the text states outright that the ridges on Europa are parallel and furthermore refers to Greenland’s ridges as ""strikingly similar"" to those on Europa.

The text indicates that although two subspecies of the birds live in the same region, the tail feathers of the migrating males make a higher-pitched sound than the tail feathers of the nonmigrating males do. Gómez-Bahamón and her team hypothesize that female fork-tailed flycatchers are attracted to the particular sound made by the tail feathers of males of their own subspecies, which will bring about additional “genetic and anatomical divergence” between the two subspecies. If it were found that the pitch generated by the tail feathers of migrating males is getting higher over successive generations, it would indicate that the shape of the migrating subspecies’ tail feathers is diverging further from that of the nonmigrating subspecies. And if females continue to prefer the sounds of the males of their own subspecies, the females of the migrating subspecies will become acclimated to increasingly higher pitches over subsequent generations, causing further divergence between the subspecies. Thus, if it were found that migrating males’ tail feathers were producing higher pitches over time, that would support the researchers’ hypothesis. Choice A is incorrect because the researchers’ hypothesis is that female flycatchers prefer the sounds produced by the tail feathers of males of their own subspecies, which will lead to further divergence between the two subspecies. This finding is about the shape of wing feathers and how that affects long-distance flight, whereas the hypothesis is about the shape of tail feathers and how that relates to female mate preference. Choice C is incorrect because the researchers’ hypothesis is that female flycatchers prefer the sounds produced by the tail feathers of males of their own subspecies, which will lead to further divergence between the two subspecies. This finding focuses on how the tail feather sounds communicate different messages, which doesn’t address differences between the subspecies or female preferences. Choice D is incorrect because the researchers’ hypothesis is that female flycatchers prefer the sounds produced by the tail feathers of males of their own subspecies, which will lead to further divergence between the two subspecies.

McKay first presents a somewhat negative view of New York City, describing watching “dark figures” who “sadly shuffle” to work at dawn, and then indicates that he would instead like to be “in the heart of the island of the sea.” Choice A is incorrect because the quotation focuses on a description of only one place (New York City, with its “lonely newsboy” and “red streaks” in the sky at dawn) rather than on different feelings about two places. Choice C is incorrect because the quotation focuses on a description of only one place (which isn’t named) rather than on McKay’s different feelings about two places. Choice D is incorrect because though McKay presents a negative image of an unnamed place with “tired cars” that grumble, moan, and groan, and “old milk carts“ that rumble by under “dull stars,” the quotation focuses on McKay’s feelings about only one place rather than on different feelings about two places."

Philosopher L. Sebastian Purcell has shown that surviving works of Aztec (Nahua) philosophy express a very different view.

To the extent that these works are representative of Aztec thought, Purcell’s analysis suggests that ______ blank",Which choice most logically completes the text?,A. the Aztecs would have disputed the idea that the morality of an individual’s actions can be assessed by appealing to standards of behavior that are independent of the individual’s social circumstances. | B. the Aztecs would not have accepted the notion that the morality of an individual’s actions can be fairly evaluated by people who do not live in the same society as that individual. | C. actions by members of Aztec society who contributed a great deal to their community could be judged as morally good even if those actions were inconsistent with behaviors the Aztecs regarded as good in all contexts. | D. similar actions performed by people in different social roles in Aztec society would have been regarded as morally equivalent unless those actions led to different outcomes for the community.,A,"Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion about Aztec (Nahua) ethics. The text indicates that, according to Purcell’s interpretation of available Aztec philosophical works, the Aztec ethical system views an individual’s actions in relation to that individual’s societal role and how the actions affect the community. The text contrasts this view with another held by some ethicists, namely that actions are morally good or bad regardless of the context in which they occur. Thus, Purcell’s analysis suggests that the Aztecs would have asserted that the morality of an individual’s actions are rooted in that person’s position in the community and the actions’ effects and therefore cannot be determined in the absence of that context. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text indicates that morally judging an action according to Aztec ethics requires an understanding of the action’s effects and the individual’s social circumstances, it does not specify that only members of that society can acquire this information. Choice C is incorrect because it implies that the Aztecs considered some actions good or bad regardless of the surrounding context, which contradicts the text’s claim that the Aztecs believed that the morality of an individual’s action is dependent on the action’s effects on the community and the person’s specific circumstances. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text indicates that in Aztec ethics the morality of an action depends in part on how it affects the community, this is only one of the two factors—the other being the person’s societal role—that need to be considered. Therefore, it is possible that two actions with the same effect on the community could be considered morally distinct if they are performed by individuals in different social roles."

If this intuition is correct and we lack an inviolable duty to speak truthfully, what grounds opposition to lying in the first place? Japa Pallikkathayil has advanced one answer by appealing to a duty to respect others’ agential interests: the possession of false beliefs constrains agency, and thus we ought not to impede the formation of true beliefs unless doing so prevents a greater constraint on someone’s agency or an otherwise impermissible end.",Which choice best states the main idea of the text?,"A. One potential means of justifying opposition to lying is Pallikkathayil’s argument that we have an obligation to respect other people’s agency that entails a commitment to truthfulness except in certain circumstances. | B. Many people have an intuitive sense that lying is permissible in some circumstances but lack a principled way to identify those circumstances, and Pallikkathayil’s argument may provide a means of resolving that problem. | C. Pallikkathayil’s argument suggests that if we have a duty to respect other people’s agential interests and if possession of false beliefs constrains agency, then we have an inviolable duty to speak truthfully. | D. Pallikkathayil’s argument shows that if our intuition that circumstances may make lying permissible is correct, then it is unclear whether there are any grounds for an opposition to lying in the first place.",A,"Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. The text begins by noting a common intuition that lying might sometimes be permissible, which raises the question of what is the reason for being against lying. The text then presents Pallikkathayil’s answer to this question: we have a duty to respect others’ agential interests (that is, we have an obligation to allow people to exercise their free will in order to best serve their own ends), false beliefs constrain agency (the implication here being that people who are deceived about what is true are impeded in acting in their own best interests), and so we should not hinder the formation of true beliefs (we should not deliberately deceive a person) unless doing so prevents a greater limitation on someone’s agency or prevents some otherwise impermissible end (for example, it might be morally permissible to lie to someone in the rare circumstance where a false belief would lead a person to act in their own best interest, and where they would not do so if they knew the truth). Thus, the main idea of the text is that Pallikkathayil offers a potential justification for opposing lying based on respecting agency, while still allowing for exceptions in specific circumstances. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t focus on people’s lack of a principled way to identify circumstances where lying is permissible or indicate that Pallikkathayil’s argument resolves this specific problem. Rather, the text presents Pallikkathayil’s argument that lies limit agency but may be permitted in very specific situations (to prevent a greater limitation on someone’s agency or an otherwise unacceptable outcome) as one of a number of possible arguments about why lies are undesirable but sometimes permissible. Choice C is incorrect because it directly contradicts the text. Pallikkathayil’s argument, as described in the text, wouldn’t lead to an ""inviolable duty to speak truthfully."" On the contrary, the text explicitly states that Pallikkathayil’s position is that interfering with people developing accurate beliefs is wrong, except when such interference prevents either a more significant limitation on someone’s agency or an outcome that would be unacceptable for other reasons. This indicates that Pallikkathayil’s argument allows for some exceptions to the duty to speak truthfully, making it not inviolable. Choice D is incorrect because Pallikkathayil’s argument doesn’t suggest that if it is permissible to lie in at least some circumstances, then it is unclear whether there are good reasons for opposing lying in any circumstances. Instead, the text presents Pallikkathayil as offering a specific ground for opposing lying (respecting others’ ability to act in their own best interests) while qualifying that assertion by presenting a situation in which lying might sometimes be morally permissible."

The finding that longer-headed dogs exhibited a greater difference in brain activity when listening to the speech recordings (in Spanish or Hungarian) versus the nonspeech (scrambled) recording compared with shorter-headed dogs would establish an association between an anatomical feature (head length) and responses (as measured by brain activity) to speech versus nonspeech. This observed relationship between head length and brain activity patterns during exposure to speech and nonspeech would support the team’s conclusion.

Moreover, this finding pertains to only one anatomical type (long-headed dogs), so it wouldn’t support the conclusion that anatomical differences may affect dogs’ ability to distinguish speech from nonspeech. Choice C is incorrect because it describes a finding involving a comparison between long-headed dogs listening to nonspeech and short-headed dogs listening to speech, which wouldn’t provide enough information to support the researchers’ conclusion that anatomical differences may affect dogs’ ability to distinguish speech from nonspeech. To support that conclusion, the finding would need to show how dogs with different anatomical features (for example, long-headed and short-headed dogs) respond to recordings of speech as well as recordings of nonspeech. Choice D is incorrect because it describes a finding about dogs’ ability to distinguish between a familiar language and an unfamiliar one, not between speech and nonspeech.

The passage tells us that the declaration was written in a language important to European diplomacy but not most Haitians, states that the declaration included ""a reassurance to the United States,"" and made implicit references to colonies in the Americas. Because of the messages within the declaration that were largely irrelevant to the Haitian people, we can assume that the Haitian people were not the only audience for this document. Choice A is incorrect. There’s no mention in the passage of similar documents in other countries, so there’s no basis for this inference. Choice B is incorrect. Although there’s an implicit reference to European governments when the passage discusses how the declaration was written in French, ""which was used throughout Europe as the language of international diplomacy,"" there is no discussion of the French government’s response to the declaration. Therefore, there’s no basis for this inference. Choice C is incorrect. The passage doesn’t mention the popularity of the revolution and declaration among the Haitian people, so there’s no basis for this inference."

In the quotation, Odalie describes feeling “shut up” and complains that she has “no companions” except for her “sleepy tante.” Odalie goes on to say that, as a result, her life is “dull” and she is “ready for any new sensation,” meaning she wants a change. This suggests that Odalie wishes to get away from her monotonous everyday life. Choice A is incorrect. Although this quotation includes the word “tiresome,” which means dull, it does so to suggest Odalie’s negative feelings about Mardi Gras, which is a once-a-year celebration, not her feelings about her everyday life. This quotation therefore doesn’t express that Odalie’s everyday life is monotonous or that she wishes to escape. Choice B is incorrect. Although this quotation ends by saying that Odalie lives in seclusion, or isolation, it doesn’t express that Odalie’s everyday life is monotonous or that she wishes to escape. Instead, it describes the pleasant qualities of the house Odalie lives in, saying that it has “quaint windows” and a “green and cool” courtyard that is “made musical” by the sounds of a fountain and pet birds. Choice D is incorrect because this quotation describes the lively sounds of a Mardi Gras celebration that Odalie hears through her window, not the monotony of Odalie’s everyday life or her wish to escape."

For each of three years, the table presents four book genres and the percentage of total sales for each genre in e-book format. Cookbooks, a nonfiction genre, do not require the reader to read straight through. According to the table, 10.5 percent of total cookbook sales in 2016 were in the e-book format. The 2016 percentage of e-book sales was 36.7 percent in the science fiction and fantasy genre, which are typically stories read straight through from start to finish. The higher percentage of total sales of the story-based e-books in 2016 supports the claim in the text.

The text claims that books that are not stories and do not require reading straight through are not as commercially successful in e-book format as those that do. As this choice is only comparing e-book sales for one genre, it does not support the claim. Choice C is incorrect because both science fiction and fantasy and romance novels are fiction books meant to be read straight through from beginning to end.

Air travel usually requires much more “lead time” than train travel, so short flights end up taking the same amount of time as a train trip to the same destination.

According to the text, many of Richard Hunt’s sculptures “use broad forms rather than extreme accuracy”—in other words, they are more abstract than realistic. To illustrate Hunt’s abstract approach, the text characterizes his sculpture of Arachne as “vaguely human” and his work in honor of Ida B.

According to the table, annual spending by international tourists in South Korea was $21.0 billion in 2016 and then decreased to $17.2 billion in 2017. This decrease shows that not all of the countries included in the table saw increases in annual international tourism revenue in 2017. Choice A is incorrect because the table doesn’t provide any data regarding revenue from tourism by residents of those countries. Even if that data were provided, it wouldn’t be relevant to the claim that the trend of annual increases in international tourism revenue in 2017 and 2018 was not universal.

Because coins with a silver content below 80% were widely considered unsuitable for trade, Elayi et al. speculate that a crisis in confidence in the currency occurred in Sidon around 367 BCE, which was likely relieved—despite Sidon’s persistent oppressive financial obligations—as a result of Ba’alšillem II’s successor Abd’aštart I’s decision to ______ blank",Which choice most logically completes the text?,A. proclaim that the percentage of silver in coins suitable for trade would be raised to a threshold higher than 80%. | B. keep the amount of silver in Sidonian coins consistent with that in coins minted in 367 BCE but decrease their weight. | C. begin minting heavier coins with a proportion of silver to copper similar to that in coins minted in 367 BCE. | D. fund the mining of some copper deposits that were not available to Ba’alšillem II.,B,"Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Sidonian coins. As the text explains, researchers determined that Sidonian coins were made of silver and copper and that from 450 BCE to 367 BCE, the percentage of silver in each coin decreased from 98% to 74.2% while the percentage of copper increased from 1% to 24.7%. The text indicates that because the coins containing less than 80% silver weren’t considered suitable for trade (suggesting that copper was less valuable than silver) and looked different from coins containing more silver, the researchers suspect there was a serious loss in confidence in the currency in Sidon in 367 BCE when the copper content was high. It’s reasonable to assume that it wasn’t possible to boost confidence simply by devoting a greater amount of valuable silver to the currency, since Sidon was under significant and ongoing financial pressure; however, keeping the total amount of silver the same and reducing the amount of copper in the coins would have resulted in smaller coins with a higher percentage of silver. Therefore, it makes sense to suggest that Abd’aštart I (the ruler after 367 BCE) likely restored confidence in the currency by deciding to keep the amount of silver in Sidonian coins consistent with that in coins minted in 367 BCE but to decrease the coins’ weight. Choice A is incorrect because the text conveys that a crisis in confidence in the currency of Sidon likely occurred around 367 BCE because the percentage of silver in coins had fallen below 80% (presumably because Sidon’s financial pressures meant that less silver was available for currency), making the coins unsuitable for trade. Thus, announcing that the threshold for the percentage of silver in coins would be raised—that is, that coins would need to contain even more than 80% silver to be suitable for trade—likely would have worsened the crisis rather than relieved it. Choice C is incorrect because the text strongly suggests that a crisis in confidence in the currency of Sidon was caused by the proportion of silver to copper in the coins in 367 BCE, with 74.2% being too little silver for the coins to be considered suitable for trade; therefore, it’s unlikely that minting coins with a similar proportion of silver to copper (that is, still around 74.2% silver) would have restored confidence, even if the coins were heavier. Choice D is incorrect because the text gives no indication that funding the mining of more copper would have relieved a crisis in confidence in the currency of Sidon. The text establishes that Sidonian coins that visibly contained copper weren’t considered suitable for trade, so Abd’aštart I wouldn’t have wanted to add even more copper to them, and it’s unclear how else copper mining would affect views of the currency."

The text explains that it has long been thought that East Australian humpback whales store extra energy during the feeding season and then use that energy to survive while traveling to their breeding grounds. If it were true that citizen scientists have often seen the whales feeding as they migrate to the breeding grounds, that would indicate that the whales sometimes feed and take in additional energy during the journey, meaning that they may not rely only on energy they stored before migrating.

The text also mentions that the surviving Nacional trees were found in a hard-to-reach valley in Ecuador. Given this information, it’s logical to conclude that these trees might have avoided infection because they were geographically isolated from infected Nacional trees, which prevented the airborne fungus from reaching them.

The text explains that a biosignature gas is a gas that can be used as an indicator that a planet harbors some form of life and some astronomers have proposed that NH 3 could serve as a biosignature gas. The researchers evaluating this claim found that the atmosphere of rocky planets would be unlikely to reach ""detectably high levels"" of NH 3 without biological activity, which would support the proposal of NH 3 serving as a biosignature gas. However, the text also states that mini-Neptune planets can produce NH 3 in the absence of biological activity. Thus, the text is structured to lead to the conclusion that detectable levels of NH 3 in the atmospheres of rocky planets could constitute a biosignature, but that is not the case for detectable levels of the gas in the atmospheres of mini-Neptune planets. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that biological activity likely accounts for detectable levels of NH 3 in the atmospheres of rocky planets but mini-Neptune planets can have detectable levels of NH 3 in their atmospheres in the absence of biological activity. Therefore, both rocky planets and mini-Neptune planets can have detectable levels of atmospheric NH 3 . Choice B is incorrect because the text states that for NH 3 to reach detectable levels in the atmospheres of rocky planets likely means they harbor biological activity, meaning that rocky planets with detectable NH 3 usually harbor biological activity. However, that does not entail that every rocky planet with biological activity will have detectable levels of NH 3 in their atmospheres. Choice D is incorrect because the text claims only that some astronomers have proposed using NH 3 as a biosignature gas without mentioning a minimum concentration of atmospheric NH 3 that must be met for it to function as a biosignature gas."

The text then states that 19 of the 20 moons appear to be the remains of earlier bodies that orbited Saturn but were broken apart in collisions. The one exception is a moon that orbits Saturn in the same direction as the planet’s spin, meaning that the exceptional moon’s orbit is prograde. The text goes on to state that the exceptional moon’s orbit is so eccentric that the moon may have formed through a different process than the other 19 moons. The moon with the eccentric orbit, therefore, has a prograde orbit and may not be a remnant of an earlier body that orbited Saturn. Choice A is incorrect because nothing in the text supports the idea that the moon with the eccentric orbit likely has the same origin as the moons with retrograde orbits. Although it’s true that the moon has a prograde orbit (and thus doesn’t have a retrograde orbit), the only information the text provides about the moon’s origin is that it may be different than the origin of the other 19 moons. Choice B is incorrect because the text states that the moon in question orbits Saturn in the same direction as the planet’s spin, meaning that the moon’s orbit is prograde, not that its orbit is neither prograde nor retrograde. Choice C is incorrect because the text merely notes that the moon in question has a prograde orbit without giving any indication of what likely caused that orbit."

The earth no longer seems to exist, it is buried in milky vapors that resemble a sea. We are now alone in space with the moon, which looks like another balloon travelling opposite us; and our balloon, which shines in the air, appears like another, larger moon, a world wandering in the sky amid the stars, through infinity.

The narrator and his companions are completely absorbed in the change in perspective they gain while riding in the balloon. | C. The narrator and his companions are troubled by the disorienting effects of the altitude while riding in the balloon. | D. The narrator is pleasantly surprised by his companions’ unrestrained enthusiasm about the sensation of riding in the balloon.,B,"Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. The narrator describes the view he and his companions have from the balloon: the earth lies beneath ""milky vapors,"" and the balloon itself looks like another moon. The narrator goes on to explain how the people riding in the balloon are affected by the ride, explaining that they are immersed in the experience: floating along in ""delicious inertia,"" or inactivity, like ""silent, joyous, irresponsible beings."" Thus, the main idea is that the narrator and his companions are completely absorbed in the change in perspective they gain while riding in the balloon. Choice A is incorrect because the narrator never describes himself as feeling isolated from his companions; instead, he characterizes riding in the balloon as an experience he is sharing with them. And although he does imply a sense of isolation, it is isolation from those on the ground, as when he says of himself and his companions, ""We are now alone."" Choice C is incorrect because the narrator doesn’t suggest that he or his companions are troubled by the effects of the balloon ride. Instead, he describes himself and his companions as ""joyous"" and the experience of floating in the balloon as ""delicious."" Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the narrator is surprised by his companions’ response to the balloon ride. In fact, the text indicates that the narrator and his companions are having the same experience: they’re described as ""silent"" and ""motionless,"" rather than as having unrestrained enthusiasm."

The text describes two categories of gas planets: hot Jupiters, which have a mass of at least 0.25 Jupiters and an orbital period of less than 10 days, and warm Jupiters, which have the same mass characteristic but have orbital periods of more than 10 days. According to the table, four of the gas exoplanets discovered by Rodriguez and colleagues have a mass of at least 0.25 Jupiters and an orbital period of less than 10 days, while one of the planets has a mass of at least 0.25 Jupiters and an orbital period of more than 10 days. These data therefore support Rodriguez and colleagues’ assertion that four of the new exoplanets are hot Jupiters and one is a warm Jupiter. Choice A is incorrect because it doesn’t accurately describe the data from the table. Although the table shows that TOI-628 b has a mass equivalent to 6.33 Jupiters, the table also shows that one of the planets—TOI-1478 b—does indeed have an orbital period of more than 10 days. Choice B is incorrect because it doesn’t accurately describe the data from the table. Although the table does show that the masses of the five planets range from 0.85 to 6.33 Jupiters, the table also shows that TOI-1478 b has an orbital period of 10.180 days, not 153 days. Choice C is incorrect. According to the table, TOI-1333 b has an orbital period of only 4.720 days, not more than 10 days. Additionally, although the table does show that all the planets have a radius between 1.060 and 1.771 Jupiters, the text indicates that a planet may be classified as a hot Jupiter or a warm Jupiter based on its mass and orbital period, not on its radius, making the information about the range of the five planets’ radius values irrelevant."

According to the text, payload capacity is calculated by using a ratio of a robot’s holding force to the robot’s weight, and higher ratios indicate a greater payload capacity. The Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a holding force of 56 newtons, four times greater than that of the Yale Model T. Additionally, the graph shows that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a weight of approximately 500 grams, slightly more than the Yale Model T’s weight of approximately 480 grams. Therefore, the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a higher ratio of holding force to weight than the Yale Model T. Since higher ratios correspond to greater payload capacity, the information from the graph indicating that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand weighs only slightly more than the Yale Model T combined with the information in the text ultimately supports the conclusion that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a higher payload capacity than the Yale Model T. Choice A is incorrect. Although, according to the graph, it’s true that both the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand and the Yale Model T weigh more than 450 grams, this statement doesn’t support Meng and colleagues’ conclusion that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a higher payload capacity than the Yale Model T. This statement emphasizes a similarity, not a distinction, between the two robots. Choice B is incorrect. Although, according to the graph, it’s true that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand and the Yale Model T both weigh more than the Permanent Magnet Hand does, this statement doesn’t support Meng and colleagues’ conclusion that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a higher payload capacity than the Yale Model T. This statement emphasizes a similarity, not a distinction, between the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand and the Yale Model T. Furthermore, the comparison to the Permanent Magnet Hand is irrelevant to the claim about the relative ratios and payload capacities of the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand and the Yale Model T. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text states that the Yale Model T has a lower holding force than the Permanent Magnet Hand, the graph provides no information about holding force. Moreover, information about the Permanent Magnet Hand is irrelevant to the conclusion by Meng and colleagues, which only concerns the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand and the Yale Model T."

The text explains that urchin barrens are areas that used to be kelp forests but are now covered by purple sea urchins. The text suggests that because there is no more vegetation to be consumed in those areas, the urchins exist in a state of starvation that makes them less nutritional for many predators. The text goes on to explain that in a study with a choice between two purple sea urchins, sunflower sea stars (a predator species that has been substantially declining) consumed a nutritionally rich urchin 42.7% of the time and a nutritionally poor urchin 37.5% of the time. Because the sunflower sea stars didn’t always avoid consuming nutritionally poor urchins, even when nutritionally rich ones were available, it follows that helping sunflower sea star populations to grow could help control urchin barrens by increasing the number of sea stars that may consume and thus remove nutritionally poor purple sea urchins from barrens. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates only that when presented with purple sea urchins, the sunflower sea stars in the study consumed both nutritionally rich and nutritionally poor ones. It doesn’t suggest that sunflower sea stars generally prefer other marine animals that are more nutritious; there’s no mention of other marine animals.

In fact, the text indicates that the sunflower sea stars in the study did consume sea urchins, feeding on both nutritionally poor and nutritionally rich ones.

Therefore, the quotation effectively supports the claim that the film is best understood not as a precise retelling of a historical event but as a deeply informed imaginative rendering of that event. Choice A is incorrect. Although the quotation discusses how on learning about the 1964 meeting in Miami, Powers was inspired to write a play and, later, to adapt it into a screenplay, it doesn’t discuss Powers’s approach to representing what had occurred in the meeting. Instead, it states that Powers didn’t initially plan to write a story only “focusing on the meeting itself” but rather had considered writing a “much longer” and more expansive work about the meeting’s four participants. Choice B is incorrect because the quotation doesn’t discuss Powers’s approach to representing historical events in his play and in the film; instead, the quotation focuses on the film’s positive critical reception by mentioning that it received numerous awards and nominations. Choice C is incorrect. Although the quotation references historical events that are discussed directly in the play and film by explaining how the four historical figures featured in the story engage in political debates about contemporary issues, it doesn’t specify to what extent Powers’s representation of what occurred during the 1964 meeting in Miami is a factual retelling of what happened and how much is an imaginative rendering of what might have happened. Rather, the quotation focuses on Powers’s description of the film’s basic premise and how the characters engage with the historical context of its setting."

The text explains that the study failed to distinguish between outcomes for the tasks performed by the capuchin monkeys, such that simpler tasks requiring less dexterity, or skill, were judged by the same criteria as tasks that demanded more dexterity. Because the study didn’t account for this discrepancy, the researchers might have assumed that observed differences in performance were due to the abilities of the monkeys rather than the complexity of the tasks. In other words, the results may suggest cognitive differences among the monkeys even though such differences may not really exist.

Thus, this statement accurately cites data from the graph that support Charles and Stephens’s claim about how level of information affects voters. Choice B is incorrect. Although this statement is correct that the only probability in the graph below 50% is for low-information voters categorized as independent (orientation 4), the claim in question is about the relative likelihood that low- and high-information voters will vote, and without some reference to high-information voters, this statement cannot help support such a comparison.

To resolve the issue, geologist Yemane Asmerom and colleagues collected data from Yok Balum Cave in Central America and compared them with the Huagapo data.

The Yok Balum data show prolonged dry conditions during the same portions of the Little Ice Age in which the Huagapo data show heightened levels of rainfall. | D. The Yok Balum data and the Huagapo data show strongly correlated patterns of high rainfall during the Little Ice Age.,D,"Choice D is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would support Asmerom and colleagues’ conclusion that the ITCZ may have expanded northward and southward rather than shifting south during the Little Ice Age. The text indicates that the ITCZ, a band of clouds in the tropics that is a significant rainfall source, can change position. Data from Peru’s Huagapo Cave suggest that the ITCZ shifted south during the Little Ice Age. But according to the text, if the ITCZ moved into South America in that way, then Central America should have been drier than climate models suggest it was. In other words, rainfall should have been reduced in Central America because the ITCZ, a significant rainfall source, had shifted into South America, but climate models do not show such a reduction in Central America. The text goes on to say that Asmerom and colleagues tried to resolve this apparent conflict by collecting data from Yok Balum cave in Central America and comparing them with data from Huagapo, which led the researchers to conclude that the ITCZ may have expanded both northward and southward rather than simply shifting south. If it is true that Yok Balum in Central America and Huagapo in South America show strongly correlated patterns of high rainfall during the Little Ice Age, such a finding would support Asmerom and colleagues’ conclusion by suggesting that the two areas were affected by the same rainfall source, and thus that the ITCZ may have expanded rather than shifted. Choice A is incorrect because there is no information in the text about how, if at all, the ITCZ affects temperature in areas where it is located. Rather, the text states that temperature variations across Earth’s hemispheres can shift the position of the ITCZ. Finding that neither Yok Balum nor Huagapo data show evidence of significant local variations in temperature during the Little Ice Age would have no clear bearing on Asmerom and colleagues’ claim. Choice B is incorrect because finding that both Yok Balum and Huagapo experienced prolonged dry conditions during the Little Ice Age would not support Asmerom and colleagues’ conclusion that the ITCZ, a major source of rainfall, may have expanded northward and southward rather than simply shifting south. Dry conditions in both locations would suggest that the ITCZ did not cover either location. Additionally, finding that temperatures were elevated in both locations would have no clear bearing on Asmerom and colleagues’ conclusion, since there is no information in the text that indicates how, if at all, the ITCZ affects temperature. Choice C is incorrect because finding that Yok Balum experienced prolonged dry conditions at the same time that Huagapo experienced high rainfall would weaken Asmerom and colleagues’ conclusion, not strengthen it. Such a finding would suggest that the ITCZ shifted south and left Central America dry rather than expanding both northward and southward."

According to the text, Barrett and Rayfield believe that estimates of dinosaur bite force may be strongly influenced by the methods used to produce them—that is, that different methods may produce significantly different results. The table shows that the studies by Bates and Falkingham and by Cost et al. used the same estimation method (muscular and skeletal modeling) and produced similar bite force estimates (approximately 35,000–57,000 newtons and 35,000–63,000 newtons, respectively). The study by Meers, however, used body-mass scaling and produced a much higher bite force estimate (183,000–235,000 newtons), while the study by Gignac and Erickson used tooth-bone interaction analysis and produced a much lower bite force estimate (8,000–34,000 newtons). The fact that one method produced similar estimates in two different studies and that two different methods used in other studies produced substantially different estimates supports the idea that dinosaur bite force estimates are significantly influenced by the methodology used to produce them. Choice A is incorrect because it inaccurately describes data from the table. The table does show that the studies by Meers and by Cost et al. used different estimation methods and produced very different ranges of estimated dinosaur bite force, which would support Barrett and Rayfield’s suggestion that different methodologies may produce significantly different estimates. However, the table doesn’t show that the study by Meers produced the lowest estimated maximum bite force while the study by Cost et al. produced the highest. In fact, the study by Meers estimated a maximum bite force of approximately 235,000 newtons, which is the highest of all the estimated maximums. Choice B is incorrect. Although the data from Gignac and Ericson’s study are accurately described, a single set of findings from one study using only one methodology can’t show that different methodologies may produce significantly different dinosaur bite force estimates, as Barrett and Rayfield suggest. Choice D is incorrect. Although the table shows that the maximum bite force estimated by Cost et al. was higher than that estimated by Bates and Falkingham, the difference is relatively small; in fact, both teams estimated a minimum bite force of approximately 35,000 newtons and a maximum bite force close to approximately 60,000 newtons. Because these findings demonstrate that a single methodology (muscular and skeletal modeling) produced similar overall results in two studies, the findings don’t support Barrett and Rayfield’s suggestion that different methodologies may produce significantly different dinosaur bite force estimates."

The text explains that parthenogenesis is a form of reproduction in which a female reproduces without mating, producing an egg containing an offspring with DNA that comes entirely from its mother. After noting examples of parthenogenesis among birds, the text then reports on a discovery at the San Diego Zoo. According to the text, scientists at the zoo found that two of the zoo’s California condors weren’t similar enough to any of the zoo’s male condors to be their offspring. Given that parthenogenesis occurs without mating and results in an offspring with DNA entirely from its mother, it can reasonably be inferred that the scientists concluded that the mothers of the two condors probably didn’t mate with any of the male condors at the zoo, reproducing through parthenogenesis instead. Choice A is incorrect because the text never suggests that at least one of the condors’ mothers was born as a result of parthenogenesis. Rather, the text suggests that the two condors were themselves both probably born as a result of parthenogenesis, which would account for their lack of strong genetic resemblance to any of the male condors in the zoo’s condor enclosure. Choice B is incorrect because the text never discusses wild California condors, only California condors living at the San Diego Zoo. For this reason, the text doesn’t support a conclusion that distinguishes between how California condors reproduce in zoos and how they reproduce in the wild.

A. thaliana increases ELF3 production as temperatures rise. | C. ELF3 enables A. thaliana to respond to increased temperatures. | D. temperatures of at least 22° Celsius are required for A. thaliana to flower.,C,"Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of accelerated flowering in A. thaliana plants. The text indicates that A. thaliana plants show accelerated flowering at high temperatures. To investigate the mechanism for this accelerated flowering, biologists replaced the ELF3 protein in one group of A. thaliana plants with a similar protein found in another plant species that doesn’t show accelerated flowering. The team then compared these modified plants to A. thaliana plants that retained their original ELF3 protein. The text states that the two samples of plants showed no difference in flowering at 22° Celsius, but at 27° Celsius the unaltered plants with ELF3 showed accelerated flowering while the plants without ELF3 didn’t. If accelerated flowering at the higher temperature occurred in the A. thaliana plants with ELF3 but not in the plants without the protein, then ELF3 likely enables A. thaliana to respond to increased temperatures. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t mention whether any plants other than A. thaliana and stiff brome show temperature-sensitive flowering, so there is no support for the idea that this type of flowering is unique to A. thaliana . Choice B is incorrect because the text discusses the effects of ELF3 and not the production of it. There’s nothing in the text to suggest that the amount of ELF3 in A. thaliana varies with temperature. Choice D is incorrect. While the text states that there was no difference in the flowering of modified and unmodified A. thaliana plants at 22° Celsius, there’s no suggestion that A. thaliana only begins to flower at 22° Celsius; the text doesn’t mention a specific temperature threshold required for A. thaliana flowering."

The passage explains that heliographs “were largely effective only during the daytime” and that “the range of the device depended on factors such as the opacity of the air and line of sight.” These constraints would have greatly limited the use of the heliograph, so we can infer that this would have been a reason to replace it with new technology. Choice A is incorrect. The passage doesn’t discuss the production and maintenance of heliographs, so there’s no basis for this inference. Choice C is incorrect. The passage doesn’t mention any “other purposes” that a heliograph wouldn’t work for, so there’s no basis for this inference. Choice D is incorrect. The passage doesn’t mention knowledge of Morse code as a particular problem with the use of heliographs, so there’s no basis for this inference."

Before the invention of portable X-ray fluorescence, researchers needed to take a small piece out of an artifact to analyze its components.",C,"Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. According to the text, thousands of ceramic bowls were found in a recovered Chinese shipwreck. The text goes on to say that Niziolek and her team used a special tool, a portable X-ray fluorescence analyzer, to determine the bowls’ chemical signatures. Comparing these chemical signatures with the chemical signatures of materials they had collected from old Chinese kiln sites, the text says, allowed the researchers to identify which kilns had produced the bowls. In other words, the researchers determined the bowls’ origin. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text indicates that the researchers used technology in the form of a portable X-ray fluorescence analyzer, it doesn’t specifically state that this technology is new. In addition, the text says that Niziolek and her team used the tool to determine the chemical composition of bowls that were found in a Chinese shipwreck, not to locate and recover the shipwreck itself. There’s no indication in the text that a new technology can help researchers locate and recover shipwrecks. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that the researchers collected materials from old kiln sites for chemical comparison with the ceramic bowls, which means that the researchers must have already known the location of those kiln sites. Rather than identifying the location of the kilns, the researchers determined which kilns in operation 1,000 years ago had likely produced the bowls that were found in the shipwreck. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text says that using a portable X-ray fluorescence analyzer tool enabled Niziolek and her team to analyze artifacts in the form of ceramic bowls without damaging them, the text doesn’t discuss how researchers analyzed artifacts before this tool was invented. Moreover, the point that the bowls were left undamaged isn’t the text’s main idea. Rather, it’s a detail that’s provided to develop the main idea, which is that the researchers used a special tool to determine where the bowls had been produced."

They likely have a different view about which activities should be considered capitalist in nature than historians of capitalism do. | D. They likely view capitalism as having been more beneficial for Africa than historians of capitalism do.,A,"Choice A is the best answer because it presents a statement about Alfagali and other Africanist scholars that is supported by the text. The last sentence of the text explains that historians of capitalism generally rely on a type of data that requires ""archival records, which do not exist for much of precolonial Africa."" Nevertheless, Alfagali and other Africanist scholars have demonstrated that features of capitalism including ""returns-focused investment,...open markets for wage labor, and other features of capitalism"" existed in parts of Africa before colonization. Because archival records typically used by historians of capitalism aren′t available for precolonial Africa, Alfagali and other Africanist scholars of precolonial capitalism in Africa likely used atypical sources for their studies. Choice B is incorrect because the text states that archival records containing longitudinal economic data ""do not exist for much of precolonial Africa."" If these records don’t exist for precolonial Africa, then Alfagali and other Africanist scholars couldn’t derive data from them by any method. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that Alfagali and other Africanist scholars define capitalism differently than other historians of capitalism do. On the contrary, the text simply asserts that specific features they found, such as ""returns-focused investment [and] open markets for wage labor,"" are ""features of capitalism,"" which implies scholarly agreement that these activities are capitalist in nature.

The text indicates that Wendy Carlos scored three feature films: A Clockwork Orange , The Shining , and Tron . It also indicates that Carlos’s work on A Clockwork Orange consisted primarily of electronic arrangements of Beethoven compositions and that very little of what she and Rachel Elkind composed for The Shining was used in the film. But the soundtrack for Tron consists largely of music composed by Carlos, so it contains more of her original music than do the soundtracks for the other two films.

The text begins by stating that the simulations led the researchers to conclude that the solar system likely formed from three giant dust rings that encircled the Sun. The text explains that the four inner planets, including Earth, formed from the innermost ring and that the remaining planets formed from the middle ring. It then explains that in one simulation, the researchers delayed the formation of the middle ring—that is, they tested to see what would happen if the middle ring had formed later than it actually did. They found that doing so affected the size of the innermost planets, resulting in oversized super-Earths, planets that are much larger than Earth. Since the delayed timing had the effect of changing the size of Earth in the simulation relative to Earth’s real size, it’s reasonable to conclude that the timing of the middle ring’s formation was important in determining Earth’s eventual size.

The text explains that the northern and southern branches of the Uto-Aztecan language family descended from a single language (believed to have originated in what is now the US Southwest), resulting in similarities across the family’s languages; however, the branches don’t have similar vocabulary for maize, even though maize has been cultivated by all Uto-Aztecan tribes. The text also indicates that maize originated in Mexico and spread northward into what is now the US Southwest—the area where the Uto-Aztecan language family originated. It follows, then, that the language family had already divided into northern and southern branches before maize reached that area; if maize had been present before the division occurred, the family’s origin language would have had terminology for it that likely would have been reflected in the branches, meaning they would have had similar vocabulary for maize. If maize arrived after the division occurred, however, the tribes in the two regions likely would have developed vocabulary pertaining to maize separately, at the times when they acquired the crop.

Moreover, if northern Uto-Aztecan tribes had acquired maize from a southern Uto-Aztecan tribe, it’s reasonable to assume that the northern tribes might have also picked up southern Uto-Aztecan terminology for maize in that exchange. Choice B is incorrect because the text discusses the fact that the northern and southern branches of the Uto-Aztecan language family don’t have shared vocabulary pertaining to maize, not the idea that there are variations in such vocabulary within each branch—that is, the text focuses on differences between the two branches, not on differences between languages within a branch. Choice C is incorrect because the text focuses on vocabulary pertaining to maize in the branches of the Uto-Aztecan language family, and referring only to the timing and source of maize acquisition wouldn’t directly address the role of language.

The values on the x-axis represent survey participants grouped by their own ignobility scores, from low ignobility (1) to high ignobility (7), while the values on the y-axis represent the likability scores given to the political candidates. The graph shows that the full range of participants (from least to most ignoble) gave the admirable-trait candidates (represented by the line with triangles) a likability rating of approximately 70 out of 100; that is, regardless of their own level of ignobility, participants generally found admirable-trait candidates quite likable. However, the graph shows that participants varied in their views of ignoble-trait candidates (represented by the line with squares); likability ratings increased as the participants’ own ignobility scores increased. Participants with low to medium-high ignobility scores (1 to 5) still rated the ignoble-trait candidates as less likable than the admirable-trait candidates, with all ratings falling below approximately 70, but participants with high ignobility scores (6 and 7) gave ratings equal to or higher than approximately 70. In other words, the previously observed trend of ranking admirable-trait candidates as more likable than ignoble-trait candidates persisted for participants with low to medium-high ignobility but not for participants with high ignobility. Choice A is incorrect because it describes the opposite of what the graph shows. The graph shows a positive correlation between participants’ ignobility scores and ignoble-trait candidates’ likability ratings (as participants’ ignobility scores increased, so did their ratings for ignoble-trait candidates’ likability) and no correlation between ignobility scores and admirable-trait candidates’ likability ratings (all participants gave admirable-trait candidates a rating of approximately 70 out of 100). Choice C is incorrect. The graph does show that regardless of their own ignobility scores, participants rated admirable-trait candidates as quite likable (a rating of approximately 70 out of 100). However, this doesn’t support the researchers’ conclusion because the conclusion has to do with how participants rated both types of candidates, not just the admirable-trait ones; moreover, the conclusion is that relative ratings were actually affected by the participants’ ignobility scores. Choice D is incorrect. The graph does show that only participants with an ignobility score of 6 gave the same likability score to both admirable- and ignoble-trait candidates while participants with other ignobility scores gave a different rating for each candidate, but this doesn’t support the researchers’ conclusion. The conclusion isn’t just that participants gave different ratings to the two types of candidates—it’s that participants with low to medium-high ignobility scores specifically gave higher likability ratings to admirable-trait candidates than to ignoble-trait candidates and that participants with high ignobility scores didn’t."

The text explains that economist Adam Smith’s famous metaphor of the invisible hand was putatively (that is, widely assumed but not proven) intended to illustrate a robust model (a consistently accurate generalization) of how individuals pursuing their own economic interests can create broader benefits for the population. The text then emphasizes the lack of affirmative evidence for this idea by calling out the term ""putatively,"" and explaining that, according to Gavin Kennedy, Smith used the metaphor only once in his works, in reference to specific circumstances related to the now-outdated economic view known as mercantilism, and that the metaphor didn’t garner much attention until economists in the twentieth century held it up as a paradigm (a theoretical framework in the field) and thereby implied that Smith shared some of their views on economics. By emphasizing ""putatively,"" the text implies that there is no independent reason to believe that Smith would agree with the metaphor’s use outside of the specific context for which he wrote it and that, therefore, the twentieth-century economists who used it did so to support their own views without regard for the metaphor’s importance to Smith’s work. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text indicates that Smith’s metaphor was largely ignored until some twentieth-century economists revived it and bolstered its status, the text suggests that the later economists used Smith’s metaphor to self-servingly boost their own work while ignoring the original context in which Smith wrote it. Moreover, the statement in this choice fails to reflect the text’s emphasis on Smith’s limited use of the metaphor in his work. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text indicates that some twentieth-century economists altered the significance of Smith’s metaphor, the text doesn’t suggest that the metaphor is a ""useful model"" of how aggregate benefits arise from individuals’ selfish actions, let alone that this usefulness is unaffected by taking the metaphor out of its original context. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text indicates that Smith’s metaphor was intended as a model of how individuals acting in their own interest produce aggregate benefits and it was written within the context of the now-outdated economic theory of mercantilism, these points are subordinate to the primary idea in the text, which is that Smith’s use of the metaphor was tightly constrained but twentieth-century economists ignored the original context so that they could use the metaphor to suggest, without support, that Smith would agree with their economic views."

B. tomentosa and B. macrantha thrive even when transferred to the surfaces of rocks that do not contain phosphates.",C,"Choice C is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would support the researchers’ hypothesis about the plants’ dependence on dissolving rock. The text indicates that the roots of the two plant species grow directly into quartzite rock, where hairs on the roots secrete acids that dissolve the rock. The researchers hypothesize that the plants depend on this process because dissolving rock opens spaces for the roots to grow and releases phosphates that provide the plants with phosphorus, a vital nutrient. If the plants carry out this process of dissolving rock even when the rock already has spaces into which the roots could grow, that would support the researchers’ hypothesis because it suggests that the plants are getting some advantage—such as access to phosphorus—from the action of dissolving rock. If the plants don’t benefit from dissolving rock, they would be expected to grow in the cracks that already exist, as doing so would mean that the plants don’t have to spend energy creating and secreting acids; if, however, the plants create new entry points by dissolving rock even when cracks already exist, that would support the hypothesis that they depend on dissolving rock for some benefit. Choice A is incorrect because the existence of soil-inhabiting members of the Velloziaceae family with similar root structures to those of the two species discussed in the text wouldn’t support the researchers’ hypothesis that the species discussed in the text depend on dissolving rock. If other such members exist, that might suggest that the root structures can serve more functions than secreting acids to dissolve rock (since dissolving rock may not be necessary for plants living in soil), but that wouldn’t suggest anything about whether the species discussed in the text benefit from dissolving rock. Choice B is incorrect because differences in the proportions of citric and malic acid secreted by the two species would be irrelevant to the hypothesis that the plants depend on dissolving rock. There’s no information in the text to suggest that the proportion of each acid has any bearing on the process of dissolving rock or on any benefits the plants might receive from that process. Choice D is incorrect because if the two species thrive on rocks without phosphates, that would weaken the researchers’ hypothesis that the plants depend on dissolving rock partly because dissolving rock gives them access to phosphates. If the plants can survive on rocks without getting a vital nutrient by dissolving those rocks, then either the nutrient isn’t actually vital for those plants or they can get the nutrient in some way other than by dissolving rocks."

The text states that genomic analysis of many domesticated dogs from Siberian sites dating from the last 11,000 years revealed that the dogs represented a genetically isolated population of breeds (that is, they didn’t reproduce with dogs of any outside breeds) until about 2,000 years ago, when there is evidence that the dogs began interbreeding with breeds from the Near East. The text also indicates that around the same time, the sites began to contain glass beads and other artifacts seeming to be from the Near East, even though there is no evidence that the people of those sites traveled widely outside Siberia. Because there is evidence of Near East dog breeds and Near East artifacts at Siberian sites beginning about 2,000 years ago but no evidence of the people’s travel to the Near East around that time, it’s reasonable to infer that Feuerborn and colleagues concluded that dogs and artifacts like glass beads were transported to Siberia from the Near East, starting around 2,000 years ago. Choice B is incorrect because the text explicitly states that there is no evidence that the people of the Siberian sites 2,000 years ago traveled extensively beyond Siberia, which they would’ve had to do to reach the Near East; therefore, it wouldn’t make sense to conclude that the presence of Near East dog breeds and artifacts like glass beads suggests that people from Siberia began arriving in the Near East around 2,000 years ago.

At busy intersections, this often causes a backup of vehicles waiting to turn left or being prevented from proceeding by left-turning vehicles in front of them. Transportation researcher Vikash V. Gayah claims that in urban areas eliminating the option to turn left at busy intersections—both with and without dedicated left-turn signals—would improve traffic flow and, as a result, reduce overall travel times even if such a restriction would require drivers to sometimes travel a slightly longer distance.","Which finding, if true, would most directly support the researcher’s claim?","A.

Statistics reveal that school buses in a city that eliminated left turns at most intersections took on average two minutes longer to complete their routes after the restriction took effect than they did before.",C,"Choice C is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most directly support Vikash V. Gayah’s claim that eliminating the option to turn left at busy intersections would improve traffic flow and reduce overall travel times. The text begins by describing a problem encountered by drivers in countries with right-hand traffic—namely that drivers wanting to make a left turn must wait for either gaps in oncoming traffic or for designated left-turn signals before proceeding. The resulting backup of vehicles causes increased traffic congestion at busy intersections that slows overall travel times. According to Gayah, eliminating left turns from busy intersections in urban areas would ease the congestion caused by vehicles waiting to turn left. If vehicles spend less time waiting at intersections for left turns, faster overall travel times would result even if some drivers would have to drive slightly longer distances to make the desired left turn. Drivers for package-delivery companies, who presumably spend most of the day driving to destinations across the city in which they are based, would likely provide a good indication of overall traffic patterns across the city. A finding that after a city had eliminated left turns at busy intersections, package-delivery companies were able to complete more daily deliveries on average—which implies faster travel times between package destinations—would therefore support the claim that overall travel times would decrease if left turns were eliminated at busy intersections. Choice A is incorrect because a finding that a majority of survey respondents agreed with the statement that implementing left-turn signals at all busy intersections made navigating streets in their communities easier wouldn’t support the claim that eliminating the option to turn left altogether at some busy intersections—both with and without dedicated left-turn signals—would improve the flow of traffic and overall traffic times. In fact, the text emphasizes that designated left-turn signals contribute to increased congestion because they require drivers to wait to turn left, which results in a backup of vehicles. Installing such signals at all busy intersections would thus potentially compound the problem of congestion, not improve it. Moreover, although making streets easier for drivers to navigate might indicate that left-turn signals are beneficial to drivers, it doesn’t indicate that overall travel times would necessarily be reduced. Choice B is incorrect because a study concluding that drivers wait longer to make left turns at intersections without dedicated left-turn signals than at intersections with such signals wouldn’t support the claim that eliminating the option to turn left altogether would reduce overall travel times. In fact, the finding would merely support the idea that installing left-turn signals would likely reduce the time drivers spend waiting at busy intersections that didn’t previously have left-turn signals, not that overall travel times would be reduced. Choice D is incorrect because the finding that after a restriction eliminating left turns at most intersections took effect, school buses took longer to complete their routes than they did before the restriction was implemented would contradict rather than support the researcher’s claim that eliminating left turns would reduce overall travel times."

The earth I sway; / Granite to me is potter’s clay; / Under the touch of my careless waves / It rises in turrets and sinks in caves.”",C,"Choice C is the best answer. This quotation focuses on the rock, which yells at the sea and announces its intent to “limit [the sea’s] power.” This matches the idea of confrontation and restraint in the claim we’re trying to support. Choice A is incorrect. This choice doesn’t illustrate the claim. While this quotation does focus on the rock, it suggests that the rock fears the sea. It lacks the sense of boldness and strength implied by the phrase “confront and restrain the sea.” Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn’t illustrate the claim. This quotation focuses on the sea, not the rock. Choice D is incorrect. This choice doesn’t illustrate the claim. This quotation focuses on the sea, not the rock."

Fynbos roots damage the root systems of forest plants, leaving those plants unable to acquire sufficient nutrients. | B. Fynbos roots extend close enough to the forest plants’ roots that they constitute a physical barrier that forest plants’ roots cannot pass. | C. The root systems of fynbos plants allow the plants to take in so many soil nutrients that forest plants are prevented from flourishing in the fynbos. | D. The root systems of fynbos plants enhance the soil immediately surrounding the plants, allowing them to thrive in an otherwise harsh habitat.",C,"Choice C is the best answer because it presents a conclusion about the role of fynbos roots in maintaining the border with the Afro-temperate forest that can be reasonably inferred from the text. The text states that plants in the fynbos have ""uniquely thin and long root systems that spread out over large distances to absorb nutrients from the soil."" The text then describes an experiment where forest tree seedlings grown in plots isolated from fynbos roots grew at a rate five times greater than seedlings in areas near fynbos roots. This strongly suggests that fynbos roots are depleting soil nutrients to such an extent that forest plants can’t get enough nutrients from that soil to flourish, thereby hindering the formation of any significant ""transition space"" between the habitats and helping keep the border between them sharp. Choice A is incorrect because there is no evidence in the text that fynbos roots physically damage the root systems of forest plants. Instead, the text explicitly describes fynbos plants as having ""uniquely thin and long root systems that spread out over large distances to absorb nutrients from the soil."" This description establishes that fynbos roots are specialized for efficient nutrient absorption. The experiment then confirms this function of the roots by showing that forest seedlings ""isolated from the roots of fynbos plants exhibited a growth rate five times greater"" than those near fynbos roots. This result demonstrates that when forest seedlings don’t have to compete with the nutrient-absorbing fynbos roots, they grow much better. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text does indicate that the fynbos and the Afro-temperate forest are distinct from, and adjacent to, each other and that there is ""almost no transition space"" (area of mixed fynbos and forest plants), the experiment shows that forest plants can grow in soil occupied by fynbos roots, just not very well. So, the idea that the fynbos roots physically obstruct forest plants is unsupported by the text. Choice D is incorrect because it directly contradicts the text’s claim that fynbos roots absorb nutrients from, and therefore deplete, the soil they’re in, and furthermore, nothing in the text suggests that the habitat of the fynbos is harsh in general."

Having dwelt touchingly upon their long friendship, and their sorrow at being separated, she passed lightly to the matter of their new roommates.”",D,"Choice D is the best answer because the quotation directly illustrates Patty trying hard to convince Mrs. Trent to allow the group to continue sharing a room. The phrase ""Patty did use all the diplomacy at her command"" explicitly shows her making a determined effort to be persuasive. The quotation further details Patty’s specific tactics: she ""dwelt touchingly upon their long friendship, and their sorrow at being separated."" These details illustrate the claim by suggesting that Patty carefully crafted and delivered an emotional appeal to Mrs. Trent about the effects of changing the group’s rooming situation. Choice A is incorrect because although the quotation describes a reaction by Mrs. Trent, it does not reveal anything about the events or conversation that might have prompted this reaction. Instead of depicting Patty’s efforts to be persuasive during such a conversation, the quotation focuses on Mrs. Trent’s character traits; specifically, it describes the relationship between her ""sense of humour"" and her ""sense of justice."" While the latter trait may be relevant to Patty’s situation, the quotation doesn’t show the extent of her efforts to convince Mrs. Trent to reconsider the change in rooming arrangements. Choice B is incorrect because this quotation describes the reaction of a group of three students immediately after an encounter with Mrs. Trent. It shows the outcome of an implied conversation but does not provide any evidence about the topic or nature of the conversation itself, and therefore does not illustrate Patty’s efforts during a conversation to convince Mrs. Trent to change her mind about the rooming situation. Choice C is incorrect because although this quotation suggests that Patty can be assertive (she abruptly grabbed her friends and ""shoved them into the empty schoolroom""), it doesn’t show Patty asserting herself by trying to convince Mrs. Trent to reconsider the proposed rooming arrangements. The quotation doesn’t allude to Mrs. Trent or to Patty’s desire to continue sharing a room with a group of friends."

The text compares the needs of a “fragile and lovely flower” to those of the speaker’s “tender mind”: both need to be fed if they’re going to survive. Without such feeding, they’ll “beginneth straightway to languish,” or weaken. Thus, the text suggests that the human mind is like a flower in that they both need proper nourishment in order to thrive. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t address the passage of time or describe either the human mind or a flower as becoming increasingly vigorous. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that human minds or flowers draw strength from changes in weather. The references to rain in the text pertain to a flower’s need for water rather than the general effects of changing weather.

Recent analysis comparing turkey remains at Mesa Verde, one such village in southern Colorado, to samples from modern turkey populations in the Rio Grande Valley of north central New Mexico determined that the latter birds descended in part from turkeys cultivated at Mesa Verde, with shared genetic markers appearing only after 1280.

Indigenous peoples living in the Rio Grande Valley primarily planted crops and did not cultivate turkeys before 1280. | D. the Ancestral Puebloans of Mesa Verde likely adopted the farming practices of Indigenous peoples living in other regions.,B,"Choice B is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text’s discussion of Ancestral Puebloans’ migration to the Rio Grande Valley. The text states that in the late 1200s C.E., the Ancestral Puebloan civilization abandoned villages in its original homeland, which included the Mesa Verde site. The text goes on to say that recent genetic analysis has demonstrated that the modern turkey population in the Rio Grande Valley descends partly from the ancient turkeys raised at Mesa Verde, and that the genetic markers shared by the two turkey populations first appeared at Mesa Verde only after 1280 C.E. Therefore, it can reasonably be concluded that some Ancestral Puebloans migrated to the Rio Grande Valley in the late 1200s and carried their agricultural practices—including the farming of turkeys—to their new home. Choice A is incorrect because the text never compares the condition of the Rio Grande Valley’s terrain to that of Mesa Verde’s terrain, either in the present or in the past. Choice C is incorrect. Although genetic analysis has demonstrated that the modern turkey population in the Rio Grande valley descended in part from the turkey population raised by the Ancestral Puebloans of Mesa Verde before their migration to the valley in 1280, this finding doesn’t eliminate the possibility that Indigenous peoples living in the valley before 1280 might also have farmed turkeys. Choice D is incorrect. The text doesn’t consider the possibility that before their migration to the Rio Grande Valley after 1280, the Ancestral Puebloans of Mesa Verde might have adopted turkey farming from an outside Indigenous civilization in another region; instead, the text provides evidence suggesting that the Ancestral Puebloans brought turkey farming to another region—the Rio Grande Valley—after 1280."

To recount fond memories of an afternoon spent in nature with a certain writer,A,"Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states the main purpose of the text. In the first part of the text, the speaker addresses Paul Laurence Dunbar’s ability to understand people (he has “read the hearts and souls of men” and written of their “joy and mirth”). In the second part of the text, the speaker describes Dunbar’s thorough understanding of the natural world (he has read “the language of the flowers” and engaged with “the little brook”). Thus, the text mainly praises Dunbar for being especially perceptive about people and nature. Choice B is incorrect because the speaker describes Dunbar as having read the “hearts and souls of men” and the “language of flowers” to convey Dunbar’s ability to comprehend people and nature, not to suggest that Dunbar has literally read any of these things or has read a great deal about them. Choice C is incorrect because the text notes how well Dunbar has made sense of the topics he’s written about but doesn’t address any specific parts of Dunbar’s writing process beyond the suggestion that he used a pen.

The text explains that, according to some climate models, precipitation in the western United States will become concentrated into fewer, more intense rain and snow events. According to the text, Persad and her colleagues concluded that more irrigation will consequently be needed but that the change in irrigation output will be highly sensitive to, or greatly affected by, the baseline concentration of precipitation in an area. This conclusion is supported by data from the researchers’ simulations of changes in annual irrigation output in two different scenarios—one in which an area’s annual precipitation is already somewhat concentrated and one in which its annual precipitation is evenly distributed. The table shows that if baseline precipitation is somewhat concentrated, water use for irrigation will increase only slightly, whereas if baseline precipitation is evenly distributed, water use for irrigation will increase much more—9.0% for surface water and 7.9% for groundwater. This difference illustrates the researchers’ conclusion that the amount of additional water needed for irrigation will vary greatly depending on how concentrated or spread out the annual precipitation in an area already is. Choice A is incorrect because it compares changes in the amount of water being used for irrigation to changes in the amount of water entering aquifers. Persad and her colleagues’ conclusion doesn’t focus on changes to the amount of water entering aquifers; rather, the researchers’ conclusion focuses on changes to irrigation output relative to how concentrated or spread out the annual precipitation in an area is. Choice C is incorrect because it supports only part of Persad and her colleagues’ conclusion. According to the text, the researchers concluded that the concentration of precipitation into fewer events will trigger more irrigation but that this change in irrigation output will be highly sensitive to an area’s baseline concentration of annual precipitation. The data in this choice support the idea that more irrigation will be needed, but to support the rest of the researchers’ conclusion, additional data from the table are required to show that the increases in water use for irrigation will vary depending on how concentrated or spread out the annual precipitation in an area already is.

Coloration tends to be especially saturated in male birds’ feathers, and because carotenoids also confer health benefits, the deeply saturated colors generally serve to communicate what is known as an honest signal of a bird’s overall fitness to potential mates. However, ornithologist Allison J.

The text explains that because carotenoids both contribute to deeply saturated feathers and offer health benefits, having deeply saturated feathers is usually “an honest signal” (a true indication) that a bird is generally fit. However, Shultz and others have found that certain male tanagers can appear to have deeply saturated feathers even if they haven’t consumed a diet rich in carotenoids, thanks to microstructures in their feathers that manipulate light. If those birds aren’t necessarily eating carotenoid-rich diets, they may actually be less fit than other birds that appear to have similarly saturated feathers; this suggests that a male tanager’s appearance may function as a dishonest signal, or a false indication, of the bird’s overall fitness. Choice A is incorrect because Shultz’s finding suggests that some tanagers can signal fitness without consuming the carotenoids that contribute to fitness, thereby making those signals dishonest, not that tanagers can give honest signals of their fitness without consuming carotenoids. Choice B is incorrect because Shultz’s finding suggests that the microstructures in certain tanagers’ feathers can give a dishonest signal of fitness, not that the microstructures are less effective than actual pigmentation for signaling fitness. Whether the signal of fitness is honest or dishonest has no bearing on how effective the signal is: a signal is effective if potential mates behave as though it’s true, regardless of whether it’s actually true. Since there’s no information in the text about how potential mates respond to the dishonest signals of some tanagers, there’s no support for the idea that the dishonest signals are less effective than the honest signals.

Some of the pits were shallow and others were quite deep.,A,"Choice A is the best answer because it presents a statement about Veronica Waweru’s thinking that is supported by the text. The text begins by discussing Waweru’s discovery of evidence that ancient versions of the board game mancala had been played at a site in the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy. The evidence consisted of many rows of shallow pits carved into stone. The text goes on to state that some newer pits were carved on top of older pits, suggesting that people may have continued to play the game there over multiple generations, creating new pits over time. The text then explicitly states that the presence of newer pits carved on top of older pits was precisely what caused Waweru to think that mancala had been played at the site for a long time. Choice B is incorrect. While the text does state that Waweru ""noticed many rows of shallow pits carved into stone,"" this observation led her to believe that the pits could have been used as game boards for ancient versions of mancala but did not specifically suggest to her that the game had been played at the site for a long time. The multiple rows of pits merely suggest that these pits functioned as part of a game board; they don’t necessarily indicate how long the site had been used for that purpose. Rather, it was the fact that there appeared to be newer pits carved on top of older pits that led Waweru to think that mancala had been played at the site for a long time. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text states that Waweru found the pits at the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy, this isn’t the reason the text gives for why she thought that mancala had been played at the site for a long time. The location of the discovery only provides information about where the game was played, not how long the game had been played there. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t mention any variation in the depth of the pits. The text only describes the pits collectively as shallow and doesn’t indicate that the depth of the pits factored into Waweru’s thinking about how long the site had been used for playing mancala."

According to the text, Jia Hu and colleagues ""hypothesized that workplace leaders who reflect on lessons learned from past mistakes are likely to exhibit more humility than leaders who don’t engage in such reflection."" The bar graph shows the humility scores for managers who participated in Jia Hu and colleagues’ study. It shows average humility scores for managers who reflected on a past mistake that they learned from, managers who reflected on a past mistake that they didn’t learn from, and managers who were in the control group that, according to the text, simply reflected on their daily routines. The graph shows that managers who reflected on a past mistake they learned from received an average humility score between 3.0 and 3.5. Both the control group and managers who reflected on a mistake they didn’t learn from received a lower average humility score of between 2.5 and 3.0. Thus, the managers who reflected on a past mistake that resulted in learning exhibited more humility on average than the managers in the other two groups did. This supports the researchers’ conclusion that their initial hypothesis that workplace leaders who reflect on past mistakes they learned from exercise greater humility was correct. Choice A is incorrect. Although according to the graph it’s true that none of the group’s humility scores exceeded 3.5, this idea does not support the researchers’ conclusion that their initial hypothesis was correct. The statement that none of the three groups’ average humility scores exceeded 3.5 does not distinguish between those leaders who reflected on lessons learned from past mistakes and those who didn’t, so it would not support Hu and colleagues’ hypothesis that workplace leaders who reflect on past mistakes they learned from exercise greater humility. Choice B is incorrect. While the graph shows that managers in the control group did exhibit less humility than the experimental group of managers who reflected on a mistake they learned from, the graph also shows that the control group exhibited more (not less) humility than the experimental group that reflected on a mistake they didn’t learn from. Furthermore, the idea that the managers in the control group exhibited only slightly less humility on average than the managers in the two experimental groups did would not support the researchers’ conclusion that their initial hypothesis that workplace leaders who reflect on past mistakes they learned from exercise greater humility was correct. Choice D is incorrect because there is no indication in the graph that all three groups of participants exhibited less humility on average than the researchers expected. The graph and text don’t cite any specific expectations that the researchers had with regard to the humility scores for each group."

The text indicates that Swahili is the first language of up to 15 million people worldwide. The text goes on to claim, in the underlined portion, that even in countries where nearly everyone speaks Swahili, many of the language’s speakers don’t have Swahili as their first language. The table indicates that 61 million people in Tanzania, which amounts to 100 percent of the population, speak Swahili. If 61 million people in Tanzania speak Swahili, but only 15 million people worldwide have Swahili as their first language, that means there are many people in Tanzania who speak Swahili as a language other than their first language. This information about Swahili speakers in Tanzania therefore supports the claim that many Swahili speakers in countries where nearly everyone speaks Swahili speak it as a language other than their first language (such as their second, third, or fourth language). Choice B is incorrect because it doesn’t accurately describe information in the table. According to the table, Tanzania has 61 million Swahili speakers, not at most 15 million Swahili speakers. Additionally, the table indicates that 100 percent of Tanzania’s population speak Swahili, which means that the number of Swahili speakers in the country and the country’s total population should be the same, not that they should differ by such a large amount. Choice C is incorrect because there’s no information in the table or the text that indicates where people who speak Swahili as their first language live. Although Kenya’s total population can be inferred from the table—if Kenya has 55 million Swahili speakers and 100% of Kenya’s population speak Swahili, then Kenya must have a population of 55 million people—nothing suggests that all the people who speak Swahili as their first language live in a single country, let alone that they all live in Kenya. Choice D is incorrect. Although the table does indicate that 100 percent of Kenya’s population and 25 percent of the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s population speak Swahili, this comparison is irrelevant to the claim that Swahili isn’t the first language of many of its speakers even in countries where almost everyone speaks Swahili. On its own, a difference in the proportions of the population who speak Swahili cannot reveal whether those Swahili speakers have Swahili as their first language or a subsequent language."

The text indicates that newborn animals of some species are attracted to faces and to stimuli that resemble faces. These species, the text says, share two characteristics: they’re social and they practice parental care, meaning that parents care for their young. The text goes on to describe Versace and colleagues’ experiment, which showed that Testudo tortoises, which aren’t social and don’t practice parental care, were attracted to a stimulus that resembles a face. Since Versace and colleagues have shown that a species that isn’t social and doesn’t practice parental care nevertheless has the innate characteristic of being attracted to face-like stimuli, it follows that this characteristic shouldn’t be assumed to be an adaptation related to social interaction or parental care. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that the tortoise hatchlings, which are solitary and don’t practice parental care, were attracted to the face-like stimuli, not that they perceived the stimuli as threatening. Choice C is incorrect because the phenomenon discussed in the text is an attraction to faces and face-like stimuli on the part of newborn animals, which can’t show any learned characteristics since they were just born. Additionally, the text tells us that the tortoises Versace and colleagues studied aren’t social and don’t practice parental care, so any findings about those tortoises wouldn’t be relevant to the question of whether an attraction to faces in social species that practice parental care is innate or learned. Choice D is incorrect because the text gives no indication that adult tortoises were tested on face-like stimuli and, if adults were in fact tested, no information about how they responded is provided. Since no information about adult tortoises’ responses is provided, no conclusion comparing those responses to the responses of newly hatched tortoises can be supported."

One tool is complex. The crows shape a stick from a rare plant into a hook. The other tool is basic. The crows find a stick without a hook on the ground. The hooked tool is harder to get but is much better than the basic tool at removing prey from holes. When studying New Caledonian crows, ecologist Barbara Klump found that they hold the hooked tools in their claws when not using them, or they carefully put them in a safe place. The crows don’t do the same with the basic tools. This suggests to Klump that the ______ blank",Which choice most logically completes the text?,A. hooked stick tools are more valuable to the crows than the stick tools without hooks. | B. hooked stick tools are easier for most of the crows to hold than the stick tools without hooks. | C. crows prefer to share their hooked stick tools but don’t share the stick tools without hooks. | D. crows realize that both kinds of stick tools are less effective than their claws are at removing prey from holes.,A,"Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the two types of stick tools used by New Caledonian crows. The text indicates that the more effective type of tool has a hook that the crows make themselves, while the other type of tool is simply a stick without a hook that the crows find and don’t shape in any way. According to the text, Klump found that the crows keep hooked tools—but not the tools without hooks—in their grasp or in safe places when they aren’t using the tools. If the hooked tools are more effective than the tools without hooks are and the crows are more protective of the hooked tools than they are of the tools without hooks, it’s reasonable to conclude that the hooked tools are more valuable to the crows than the tools without hooks are. Choice B is incorrect because the text gives no indication of how easy it is for the crows to hold either the hooked tools or the tools without hooks. The text does state that crows hold the hooked tools and not the tools without hooks when the tools aren’t in use. However, the text also indicates that the hooked tools require work from the crows to make and are more useful for helping the crows catch prey than the tools without hooks are. This context suggests that the crows hold the hooked tools because they’re more valuable to the crows than the tools without hooks are, not because the hooked tools are easier to hold. Choice C is incorrect because the text makes no mention of the crows sharing tools. Additionally, the text indicates that when the crows aren’t using the hooked tools, they either grasp the tools or store them safely, which suggests that the crows try to maintain possession of the hooked tools, not that crows prefer to share those tools. Choice D is incorrect because the text says nothing about the crows using their claws to remove prey from holes, so there’s no evidence that the crows perceive the stick tools to be less effective than their claws are."

The researchers concluded that the nitrogen fertilizer increases cantaloupe yield.",Which choice best describes data in the graph that support the researchers’ conclusion?,"A. In every year of the experiment, plants treated with the nitrogen fertilizer had a yield of at least 30 pounds per acre. | B. In every year of the experiment, plants treated with the nitrogen fertilizer had a greater yield than did plants treated with the control fertilizer. | C. The 2018 yield for plants treated with the control fertilizer was greater than was the 2019 yield for plants treated with the nitrogen fertilizer. | D. The yield for plants treated with the nitrogen fertilizer increased from 2017 to 2018.",B,"Choice B is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that support the researchers’ conclusion that using nitrogen fertilizer increases cantaloupe production. The bar graph shows the cantaloupe yield for plants grown with nitrogen fertilizer and for those grown with a control fertilizer (without nitrogen) for three consecutive years (2017–2019). For each year in the graph, the yield for the nitrogen group is greater than the yield for the control group. In pounds per acre, the value in 2017 for the nitrogen-group yield is greater than 30 while the control-group yield is less than 25; in 2018 the nitrogen-group yield is greater than 40 while the control-group yield is less than 35; and in 2019 the nitrogen-group yield is greater than 25 while the control-group yield is less than 20. Thus, these data from the graph strongly support the conclusion that using nitrogen fertilizer increases cantaloupe yield. Choice A is incorrect because the bar graph shows that in 2019 the nitrogen group had a yield below 30 pounds per acre. Choice C is incorrect. Although this choice accurately describes data in the bar graph—in 2018, the control-group yield is greater than 30 pounds per acre, and in 2019 the nitrogen-group yield is less than 30 pounds per acre—a claim that the control-group yield exceeds that of the nitrogen group strongly conflicts with the researchers’ conclusion that nitrogen fertilizer produces larger yields. Choice D is incorrect. Although it is true that the bar graph shows a higher yield for the nitrogen group in 2018 than in 2017, without the control to compare against, it is impossible to know whether the increase is due to the fertilizer and not, for example, more favorable weather in 2018 than in 2017."

However, he ironically suggests that this definition excludes mercy and forgiveness—qualities that are also thought of as virtues; according to him, Lady Chiltern is “pitiless in her perfection—cold and stern and without mercy.” This description supports the idea that Lady Chiltern is perceived by others as virtuous as well as unforgiving. Choice A is incorrect. The quotation supports the claim that Lady Chiltern is perceived as virtuous, in that it describes her as “a woman of the very highest principles.” However, it doesn’t characterize her as unforgiving or being perceived as such. Choice B is incorrect. The quotation suggests that Lady Chiltern is concerned with morality, but it suggests that her interest in discussing it is fundamentally hypocritical and functions as a means by which to judge others. However, the quotation doesn’t address the question of whether Lady Chiltern is unmerciful to those who seek forgiveness for harm they have caused. Choice D is incorrect because it doesn’t address either Lady Chiltern’s perceived virtuousness or her perceived lack of forgiveness; instead, it expresses the belief that she is sensible."

Although the graph shows that students in Study 2 assigned a higher value to the tickets than did the age-diverse group in Study 1, which would support the idea that consumer valuations were heterogeneous, the graph shows that in the ""pay what you can"" (i.e., what you can afford) condition, the students in Study 2 assigned a higher price (about $40), not a lower price, than the age-diverse group in Study 1 did (about $30). Moreover, even if it were true that the students had assigned a lower price in this condition, it wouldn’t support the result described in the text, only that the participants across the two studies had different ideas of what they can afford to pay. Choice B is incorrect. Although a finding that participants tended to choose prices that were closest to the actual ticket costs in the ""pay what you think it’s worth"" condition would support the idea that sellers benefit by prompting consumers to think about their own valuations (since it’s implied that sellers would lose money in the other conditions, where chosen prices were lower than the participants’ valuations), neither the text nor the graph addresses how any of the prices chosen by the study participants relate to the tickets’ actual market price. Choice D is incorrect. Although the wide variation in participant valuations would support the idea that consumer valuations tend to be heterogeneous, neither the text nor the graph provides any information from which to discern the relative levels of variance among the responses from participants in either study."

By indicating that a collective didn’t continue because it was hard to share credit and responsibilities within the group even though the company was enjoyable, the quotation shows that working collaboratively can be difficult for artists who are used to having complete control over their work. Choice B is incorrect because the quotation indicates that members of a collective are able to collaborate together and have agreed on a fair way to manage their responsibilities; this doesn’t demonstrate the challenge of sharing control among members of a collective. Choice C is incorrect because the quotation highlights the support and encouragement of individual expression an artist experiences due to working in a collective; these positive aspects don’t demonstrate the challenge of sharing control among members of a collective.

The text indicates that judges sometimes cite philosophers when writing their judicial opinions and that, according to Allen, judges tend to cite philosophers whose views are in agreement with those of the judges themselves. Allen claims, however, that the best judicial opinions consider potential objections and rebut them, which suggests that judges may be able to strengthen their opinions by including discussions of philosophers with views contrary to their own. Choice A is incorrect because Allen’s claim is that judges could improve their judicial opinions by citing philosophers who disagree with the views expressed in the opinions, which would necessarily require judges to consult philosophical works.

One of the oldest examples, the Fairfield Gorget, was found in Fairfield, Missouri, in 1958. Its overall design resembles that of other art from the region during the Mississippian period (900–1600 CE). Yet the image on the gorget is of a jaguar—a species whose range doesn’t extend to Missouri. Jaguar images are common in ancient Mexican art, and Mexico lies squarely in the species’ range. Therefore, some scholars argue that long-distance trade in Mexican art objects brought the imagery to Missouri, where a local artist could have adopted it and incorporated it into the Fairfield Gorget.","Which finding, if true, would most strongly support the underlined explanation?","A.

An ancient Mexican art object is found at a site that dates to the Mississippian period and is close to where the Fairfield Gorget was found. | D. Certain works by present-day artists from Southeastern tribes reflect outside cultural influences, including contemporary Mexican art.",C,"Choice C is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most strongly support the underlined explanation that the jaguar imagery on the Fairfield Gorget could have been inspired by art objects brought to Missouri from Mexico. The text describes the Fairfield Gorget as one of the oldest examples of these necklaces, noting that it’s similar to other art from the Mississippian period except for its image of a jaguar. The text goes on to explain that this is unusual because the jaguar’s range didn’t include Missouri. The Fairfield Gorget’s artist likely wouldn’t have encountered a live jaguar, but since such jaguar images were common in ancient Mexican art (and the jaguar’s range did include Mexico), perhaps some of that art inspired the gorget’s artist. Therefore, evidence that an ancient Mexican art object had been found at a site that was close to the Fairfield Gorget in both location and time period would strongly support the explanation that long-distance trade from Mexico took place during the Mississippian period and that jaguar imagery could have reached Missouri by those means. Choice A is incorrect. The underlined explanation indicates that Mexican artistic influence preceded the creation of the Fairfield Gorget. An artifact from Mexico that appeared in Missouri only after the gorget was created cannot support such a claim. Choice B is incorrect. The underlined explanation pertains to whether the jaguar image on the Fairfield Gorget was suggested to the Mississippian artist who made it by encounters with depictions of jaguars in Mexican art. The appearance of jaguars in Missouri after the Mississippian period cannot provide evidence for such a claim. Choice D is incorrect. The underlined explanation pertains to influence that Mexican art might have had on Mississippian art, restricted to the period from 900 CE to 1600 CE. The actions of contemporary artists cannot provide evidence for centuries-old networks of artistic influence and exchange."

The table indicates that Lillian St. Cyr has 66 film credits as an actor and that Edwin Carewe has 58 film credits as a director; it follows that if some films and records for the era were lost, it’s possible that Lillian St. Cyr acted in far more than 66 films and that Edwin Carewe directed more than 58 films.

The text begins by explaining that many repellents work by using natural components to activate multiple odor receptors on mosquitoes’ antennae, and that new repellents must be created whenever mosquitoes become resistant to older ones. The text then highlights a research team’s discovery that EBF, a molecular component of a chrysanthemum-flower extract, can repel mosquitoes by activating a single odor receptor, Or31, that is shared by all species of mosquitoes known to carry diseases. The text suggests that compared to the repellents mentioned earlier, a repellent that acts on the Or31 receptor would be more effective: by noting that all mosquito species known to carry diseases share the Or31 receptor, the text suggests that the Or31 receptor may be unique in this respect, meaning that a repellent such as EBF that acts on it would be more effective since it works on a single receptor shared by all mosquito species that carry diseases, rather than a combination of receptors that is not shared by all species. Once mosquitoes become resistant to EBF, it would therefore make sense for researchers to look for other molecular components similar to EBF that target the activation of Or31 receptors, since a single such component could also repel all disease-carrying mosquitoes. Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that EBF molecules are difficult to extract from chrysanthemums and that investigating alternative extraction methods would therefore be useful for developing efficient and effective mosquito repellents. Rather, the text suggests that researchers developing new mosquito repellents should aim to identify molecular components similar to EBF, since that component targets the Or31 odor receptor shared by all species of mosquitoes known to carry diseases. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that researchers are unaware of the precise location of Or31 and other odor receptors in mosquitoes’ antennae or that knowing this information would be useful for developing efficient and effective mosquito repellents. Rather, the text suggests that researchers developing new mosquito repellents should aim to identify molecular components similar to EBF, which targets the Or31 odor receptor. Choice D is incorrect because it doesn’t logically follow that the discovery of one odor receptor shared by all disease-bearing mosquitoes should lead to further research into which repellents might activate the greatest number of odor receptors. Rather, the text suggests that researchers developing new mosquito repellents should instead search for additional molecular components that, like EBF, activate the one odor receptor that is known to be shared by all disease-bearing mosquitoes."

Miranda’s impression of a scene is vague because she is remembering a scenario she had daydreamed about as a child rather than a scenario that had occurred in reality.,C,"Choice C is the best answer because it presents a point that Prospero makes about Miranda. The text begins with Miranda responding to Prospero’s claim that she probably doesn’t remember her life before the island. She describes a distant memory, asking if she had ""four or five women"" caring for her. Prospero confirms this (""thou hadst"") and then asks what else she can recall, stating that because she remembers one thing from the time before she lived on the island (""ought ere thou camest here""), she might also remember arriving on the island (""how thou camest here""). That is, Prospero indicates that Miranda’s ability to summon details of an experience from before her arrival on the island suggests that she may also be able to summon details of her arrival. Choice A is incorrect because Prospero doesn’t say anything about how Miranda presents her early childhood memory of having several people care for her—he indicates only his surprise that she remembers something from so long ago (""the dark backward and abysm of time"") and his thought that she may also be able to recall another childhood event: her arrival on the island. Further, Prospero doesn’t suggest that he believes Miranda is discontent in her current circumstances. Choice B is incorrect. Although Miranda suggests some doubt about her recollection of a place other than the island, in that she describes it as ""like a dream"" she can’t be certain of, Prospero doesn’t mention her uncertainty—though he himself wonders how it is possible that she correctly recalls something from so long ago (""abysm of time""). Rather than indicating that doubt is making Miranda reluctant, Prospero simply states that Miranda may have the ability to remember traveling to the island. Choice D is incorrect. Although Miranda describes a vague impression of several people who cared for her as a young child and states that it is ""rather like a dream"" instead of something she is certain is real, Prospero doesn’t indicate that Miranda is remembering a childhood daydream.

Therefore, if A. ocellaris were to settle only in regions where the fish would be regularly exposed to low levels of ALAN, their eggs would stop hatching and their reproductive success would be at risk.

The table shows that the correlations with velocity are farther from zero than the correlations with density, which supports the conclusion that the correlations with velocity are stronger. Choice A is incorrect. This choice doesn’t support the conclusion. It makes an “apples to oranges” comparison by comparing density and velocity correlations across features instead of comparing them for each feature. Choice B is incorrect.

Karla A. Camacho-Cruz and colleagues assessed delta 15-N values in the seagrass Thalassia testudinum from sites on Mexico’s Yucatan peninsula with intermediate tourism development, including Akumal Bay and Tulum, and low tourism development, including Mahahual and Xahuayxol, throughout 2016 and 2017.

In Akumal Bay and Tulum, delta 15-N values fluctuated considerably across the three measurements made from October 2016 to October 2017.",D,"Choice D is the best answer because it describes data from the table that support the underlined conclusion. The text accompanying the table states that delta 15-N values (a measure of the ratio of two nitrogen isotopes) can be used as an indirect means of measuring the ratio of human wastewater to water from uncontaminated sources—the higher the delta 15-N values, the greater the presence of human wastewater. The text goes on to mention an experiment conducted by Camacho-Cruz and colleagues measuring delta 15-N values in seagrass on the Yucatan peninsula at several sites, four of which are presented in the table accompanying the text. Two of the sites noted in the table, Akumal Bay and Tulum, had intermediate tourism development, and two others, Mahahual and Xahuayxol, had low tourism development. It is reasonable to infer that sites with intermediate tourism have a greater human presence than those with low tourism and therefore are subject to greater amounts of wastewater and exhibit higher delta 15-N values in seagrass. However, Camacho-Cruz and colleagues found that the increase in delta 15-N values was not constant. The table supports this conclusion because the two intermediate-tourism sites (Akumal Bay and Tulum) had delta 15-N values that fluctuated considerably—both had higher delta 15-N values than the two low-tourism sites (Mahahual and Xahuayxol) in October 2016 and October 2017, but in February 2017 the delta 15-N values for the intermediate-tourism sites dropped significantly (in fact, Mahahual, a low-tourism site, had a higher delta 15-N value for that period). The fluctuations in values in Akumal Bay and Tulum support the conclusion that these sites experienced influxes of human wastewater intermittently. Choice A is incorrect because it inaccurately describes data from the table: in February 2017 the delta 15-N value in Akumal Bay was higher than the delta 15-N value in Xahuayxol, not lower. Choice B is incorrect because the absence of data for delta 15-N levels in Akumal Bay in February 2016 would neither prove nor disprove that the presence of human wastewater at Akumal Bay and Tulum was not constant. Despite the unavailable data, there is still enough information to conclude that delta 15-N levels at both sites fluctuated significantly and that influxes of human wastewater therefore happened intermittently. Choice C is incorrect because a constancy in delta 15-N values would not indicate that the influx of human wastewater was intermittent, but rather the opposite. Moreover, the two periods selected are not indicative of general trends in the whole table (for example, the values fluctuated significantly in Akumal Bay between February 2017 and October 2017, and in Tulum between October 2016 and February 2017)."

The text indicates that Miranda-Pérez and her team found that adding a layer of perovskite to silicon-based cells increased the percentage of sunlight converted to usable electricity relative to the percentage converted to electricity by silicon-based cells. Using cells with only perovskite and no silicon, however, resulted in no improvement in efficiency over silicon-based cells. The text also states that perovskite captures light in the blue range of the solar spectrum and silicon captures light in the red range of the spectrum. If perovskite and silicon capture different parts of the solar spectrum and the combination of perovskite and silicon results in greater efficiency than the use of either perovskite or silicon alone does, then it is reasonable to infer that the improved efficiency of perovskite-silicon cells could be attributable to their making use of more of the solar spectrum than perovskite-based or silicon-based cells do. Choice B is incorrect because it is directly contradicted by the text, which says that silicon-based cells convert 18%–22% of the sunlight that reaches them to electricity and that cells with only perovskite are no more efficient than silicon-based cells are. Perovskite-only cells thus must convert 22% or less—not more than 29.5%—of the sunlight that reaches them to electricity. Choice C is incorrect because the text focuses on a possible improvement to photovoltaic cells and makes no mention of any alternatives to those cells, so there is no reason to conclude that photovoltaic cells must be replaced with some other technology. Additionally, the text presents solar power as something that currently exists, so it wouldn’t make sense to conclude that solar power will remain elusive. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that there is a need to evaluate the effectiveness of other minerals than perovskite. In fact, the text gives no indication that it is even possible to use other minerals than silicon and perovskite in photovoltaic cells. Instead, the text is focused on the effect of combining perovskite and silicon and the different parts of the solar spectrum that perovskite and silicon capture."

Olive trees thrive in areas with hot, dry summers.",C,"Choice C is the best answer because it presents a detail that, if true, would most directly support the researcher’s claim about the difficulty of determining olive tree age by ring counting. The text explains that for many trees, counting the dark rings visible in a tree stump is a reliable method for determining the tree’s age. However, if olive trees have growth rings that are difficult to see, it would be hard to count the individual rings. Therefore, the ring-counting method would be challenging or impossible to use for olive trees. This directly supports the researcher’s claim that the ring-counting method often can’t be used for olive trees because it identifies a specific characteristic of olive trees that could render this approach impracticable. Choice A is incorrect because the probable age of the oldest olive tree doesn’t explain why counting rings wouldn’t work for determining olive tree age. The older age of some olive trees might make counting more tedious but doesn’t pose an insurmountable obstacle to adopting the method. The researcher’s claim is about the feasibility of the ring-counting method for olive trees, not about the potential impracticality of employing this method for particularly long-lived trees. Choice B is incorrect because the fact that narrow growth rings might indicate harsh growing conditions has no direct bearing on the claim that counting rings often can’t be used to determine olive tree age. It is possible that growth rings that are too narrowly spaced might be difficult to count, but the researcher’s claim relates to the inapplicability of the ring-counting method to olive trees in general rather than to olive trees that have experienced harsh conditions. Moreover, as long as they are visible, even narrow growth rings might permit the ring-counting method to be used to determine tree age. Choice D is incorrect because the ideal climate conditions for olive trees don’t explain why counting rings wouldn’t work as a method for determining their age. While growing conditions might affect ring formation patterns, the simple fact that olive trees thrive in hot, dry environments doesn’t directly address why the conventional method of counting rings would be ineffective for determining their age."

The number of captive California condors did not steadily decrease between 2014 and 2020: rather, it increased slightly during some years and decreased slightly during others, generally remaining at slightly less than 200. Choice B is incorrect. Even though the graph does show a slight decrease in both the captive and wild condor populations from 2019 to 2020, such a decrease during a particular year would not demonstrate the program’s success. Choice C is incorrect because it does not accurately describe data from the graph. The difference between the number of captive and wild California condors did not remain relatively steady between 2014 and 2017. While the number of captive condors remained roughly the same during that period, the number of wild condors increased, so the difference between the number of captive and wild condors increased as well."

The text explains that the scientists found melanosomes in the fossilized feather of an extinct bird and that melanosomes are responsible for producing color inside cells. The text also explains that melanosomes have different shapes depending on the colors they produce. Given this information, it follows that the scientists hypothesized that they could determine the colors of the extinct bird by examining the shapes of the melanosomes in the feather. Choice A is incorrect because the text never suggests that the scientists were seeking to show how melanosomes can be found in fossils belonging to animals from other extinct species. Rather, the text indicates that the scientists were seeking to identify an extinct bird’s colors, and the text strongly suggests that the scientists hypothesized that they could achieve their goal by examining the shapes of the melanosomes in the bird’s fossilized feather. Choice C is incorrect because the text never suggests that the scientists were seeking to explain why the melanosomes in the feather were so well preserved. Rather, the text indicates that the scientists were seeking to identify an extinct bird’s colors, and the text strongly suggests that the scientists hypothesized that they could achieve their goal by examining the shapes of the melanosomes in the bird’s fossilized feather. Choice D is incorrect because the text suggests only one method of identifying the colors of extinct animals: by examining the shapes of melanosomes found in fossils. The text doesn’t discuss other methods for learning the colors of extinct animals and therefore provides no support for the idea that the scientists could identify the colors of extinct animals whose fossils lack melanosomes."

Tests of attentiveness were administered to participants three times during the study: at random for the no-leave staff, and for the rest, one week before their leave, one week following their return to work, and one week after the second test administration.

According to the text, the researchers’ study design included a group of employees who took no leave, a group who took 2–4 days of leave, and a group who took 1–5 weeks of leave. The participants who took leave were tested for attentiveness one week before their leave (the first test administration), one week after their return to work (the second test administration), and two weeks after their return (the third test administration). The participants who took no leave were tested three times at random. The graph shows that at one week after their return to work, participants who took only 2–4 days of leave had an average attentiveness score of between 540 and 600, while participants who took 1–5 weeks of leave had an average score of between 480 and 540. At two weeks after their return to work, those who took only 2–4 days of leave had an average score of between 480 and 540, while those who took 1–5 weeks of leave had an average score of approximately 480. In other words, the graph shows that on both post-leave testing dates, participants with longer leave times had lower average attentiveness scores than those with shorter leave times. Since attentiveness is an indicator of cognitive functioning, these data confirm Packer and colleagues’ conclusion that longer leave times might not confer a greater cognitive benefit than shorter leave times do. Choice A is incorrect. The graph does show that in the second test administration, participants who took 2–4 days of leave had higher average attentiveness scores than did those who took no leave and also shows that in the third test administration, those who took no leave had higher average scores than those who took 1–5 weeks of leave. But neither of these findings has a direct bearing on the researchers’ conclusion, which concerns a comparison of participants who took 2–4 days of leave with those who took 1–5 weeks, rather than a comparison of either group with participants who took no leave. Choice B is incorrect. Although the graph does show that in the first test administration, participants who took 2–4 days of leave had lower average attentiveness scores than did those who took 1–5 weeks of leave and those who took no leave, this test administration occurred before any participants went on leave; therefore, these results have no bearing on the researchers’ conclusion about how the amount of leave taken by participants affected their cognitive functioning. Choice D is incorrect. Although the graph does show that in the second and third test administrations, participants who took 2–4 days of leave had higher average attentiveness scores than did those who took no leave, the researchers’ conclusion is about the effects of short leave compared with the effects of long leave, not the effects of short leave compared with the effects of no leave. These results are therefore irrelevant to the conclusion."

According to the text, the researcher hypothesized that Arctic ground squirrels would exhibit longer torpor bouts and shorter arousal episodes than Alaska marmots do—or, put the other way, that the marmots would show shorter torpor bouts and longer arousal episodes than the ground squirrels do. The table shows data about torpor bouts and arousal episodes for the two species from 2008 to 2011. According to the table, the average duration of torpor bouts was 13.81 days for Alaska marmots, shorter than the average of 16.77 days for Arctic ground squirrels, and the average duration of arousal episodes was 21.2 hours for Alaska marmots, longer than the average of 14.2 hours for Arctic ground squirrels. Thus, the table supports the researcher’s hypothesis by showing that Alaska marmots had shorter bouts of torpor and longer arousal episodes than Arctic ground squirrels did. Choice A is incorrect because it inaccurately describes data from the table and doesn’t support the researcher’s hypothesis. The table shows that the average duration of arousal episodes was less than a day for both Alaska marmots (21.2 hours) and Arctic ground squirrels (14.2 hours). Additionally, information about arousal episodes for Alaska marmots and Arctic ground squirrels isn’t sufficient to support a hypothesis involving comparisons of both arousal episodes and torpor bouts for those animals. Choice B is incorrect because it doesn’t support the researcher’s hypothesis, which involves comparisons of arousal episodes as well as torpor bouts for Alaska marmots and Arctic ground squirrels. Noting that both animals had torpor bouts lasting several days, on average, doesn’t address arousal episodes at all, nor does it reveal how the animals’ torpor bouts compared. Choice D is incorrect because it doesn’t support the researcher’s hypothesis. Although the table does show that Alaska marmots had more torpor bouts (12) than arousal episodes (11) and that their arousal episodes were much shorter than their torpor bouts (21.2 hours and 13.81 days, respectively), comparing data across only Alaska marmot behaviors isn’t sufficient to support a hypothesis about torpor and arousal behaviors of both Alaska marmots and Arctic ground squirrels."

The text makes this claim based on the fact that ancient trade routes connected Puerto Rico with Colombia but not with Peru. However, if it’s true that ancient guinea pigs in Puerto Rico were genetically less similar to ancient guinea pigs in Colombia than to ancient guinea pigs in Peru, this would suggest that the Puerto Rican guinea pigs didn’t descend from Colombian guinea pigs.

Researchers have been puzzled because its acceleration cannot be entirely explained by the gravitational pull of nearby bodies: there must be a nongravitational influence on its velocity and trajectory. Some previously suggested explanations for this nongravitational acceleration involve mechanisms that are unlikely or unrealistic, such as geometric effects from ‘Oumuamua being potentially composed of several spatially separated bodies. Now, Jennifer Bergner and colleagues propose that the nongravitational acceleration is due to the gaseous expulsion of entrapped hydrogen from ‘Oumuamua’s water-rich icy body.","Which statement, if true, would most strongly support the claim made by Bergner and colleagues about the cause of ‘Oumuamua’s acceleration?","A. Existing proposed models of outgassing from ‘Oumuamua include the direct conversion of nitrogen or carbon monoxide from a solid to a gaseous state without becoming liquid, but these models have theoretical or observational inconsistencies. | B. ‘Oumuamua’s trajectory is inconsistent with a nongravitational acceleration that would be caused by the release of hydrogen gas resulting from the processing of water ice (H 2 O), but the interstellar object’s observable properties can be explained if it has a significant component of molecular hydrogen ice (H 2 ). | C. Since nongravitational accelerations of interstellar objects are several orders of magnitude weaker than gravitational accelerations, deviation from behavior that could be fully attributed to gravitational pull has been detected on a limited number of objects similar to ‘Oumuamua. | D. Exposure to interstellar cosmic radiation can result in the formation of embedded pockets of hydrogen gas in water ice; moreover, when traveling through the solar system, ‘Oumuamua experienced warming sufficient to alter its icy structure and allow for outgassing.",D,"Choice D is the best answer because it presents findings that, if true, would support the claim made by Bergner and colleagues that the nongravitational acceleration of ‘Oumuamua is due to the expulsion of entrapped hydrogen. The text first introduces the observation of a unique interstellar object named ‘Oumuamua and goes on to explain that the object exhibited nongravitational acceleration that could not be fully attributed to the expected cause: gravitational pull of nearby celestial bodies. The text concludes by stating that Bergner and colleagues claim that the nongravitational acceleration is caused by expulsion of hydrogen gas from ‘Oumuamua’s water-rich icy body. To support this claim requires evidence that hydrogen gas could be present within ‘Oumuamua at all, which this answer choice presents: cosmic radiation can result in embedded pockets of hydrogen gas in water ice. Additionally, evidence that this gas can be released from such a body is required to fully support the claim, which this answer choice goes on to provide: ‘Oumuamua experienced sufficient warming as it traveled through the solar system to alter its icy structure and release the hydrogen gas. Thus, this answer choice provides the best evidence to support Bergner and colleagues’ claim. Choice A is incorrect because this answer choice concerns faults with previous models of outgassing from ‘Oumuamua of carbon monoxide and nitrogen, which would not support a claim regarding hydrogen outgassing. Furthermore, inconsistencies in other models would not provide evidence in support of a different model or explanation. Choice B is incorrect. The evidence presented in this answer choice would weaken the claim proposed by Bergner and colleagues that the nongravitational acceleration of ‘Oumuamua is caused by the expulsion of hydrogen gas because this answer choice suggests that there is evidence that refutes this claim: ‘Oumuamua’s trajectory is inconsistent with a nongravitational acceleration caused by the release of hydrogen gas. Furthermore, the remaining portion of this answer choice is unrelated to the claim. Choice C is incorrect because the claim being made by Bergner and colleagues concerns the expulsion of entrapped hydrogen gas, but this answer choice is concerned solely with the differences in magnitude of gravitational and nongravitational acceleration, which would not support Bergner’s claim. Furthermore, this answer choice discusses interstellar objects similar to ‘Oumuamua, but the text states that ‘Oumuamua is the first observed object of its kind in our solar system, so evidence from other, similar bodies would not be available."

Aristotle observes that different forms of government can fall in different ways—for example, oligarchies might grant power to military leaders during wartime who refuse to relinquish that power during peacetime—but some methods of preserving order apply across all forms of government.

The philosopher states that when Aristotle builds his argument about the characteristics of a well-functioning government, Aristotle asserts that transgression, or violation of law, will ruin the state if it ""creeps in unperceived,"" or goes unnoticed. The philosopher then adds that Aristotle illustrates this point by comparing the situation to one in which small but frequent expenses diminish a fortune almost unnoticeably until, eventually, the fortune is entirely gone. In other words, the philosopher indicates that Aristotle makes the point that total obedience to law preserves a healthy state while even small violations, if ignored, will undermine the health of the state. Choice B is incorrect because the philosopher addresses Aristotle’s observation about corruption within the government (in particular, preventing the possibility that members of the government can take bribes), and although corruption can involve infractions, the observation is about a subset of people within the state and isn’t directly connected to the importance of upholding total obedience to the law throughout the state. Choice C is incorrect because the philosopher discusses Aristotle’s point about those who would intentionally destroy a constitution altogether and the need for rulers to remind the populace that it would be dangerous for a constitution to collapse, but neither idea is directly connected to the importance of upholding total obedience to the law. Choice D is incorrect because the philosopher explains that Aristotle makes the point that oligarchic leaders may retain power by having members of disenfranchised classes participate in government alongside governing classes, and this point doesn’t address the importance of ensuring obedience to the law and addressing even minor violations."

The bar graph shows the growth of sugar maple trees with and without nitrogen fertilization under three different climate-change scenarios: current conditions, a moderate change, and an extreme change. According to the graph, radial growth without nitrogen fertilization is projected to be about 0.16 centimeters (cm) under current conditions, 0.15 cm under a moderate change, and 0.04 cm under an extreme change. The graph also shows that with nitrogen fertilization, growth is projected to be about 0.18 centimeters under a moderate change but only about 0.06 centimeters under an extreme change. Thus, the data in the graph support the researchers’ conclusion by showing greater growth for a moderate change using nitrogen fertilization than they do either under current conditions without nitrogen fertilization or under an extreme change with nitrogen fertilization.

The table shows the total number of juvenile plants from five species that were found growing on bare ground and in patches of vegetation as well as the percentage of the total number of each species that were growing in patches of vegetation. For each of the five species, more than 50% of the juvenile plants were growing in patches of vegetation. The text notes, however, that a random distribution of plants across the landscape should result in only about 15% of the plants being found in patches of vegetation. In other words, for each of the five species, the percentage of juvenile plants found growing in patches of vegetation was substantially higher than could be explained by chance alone. This finding supports the claim in the text: if plants growing in patches are overrepresented among plants that have survived to the juvenile stage, as the data show they are, then it suggests that it’s advantageous for plants at an early stage of development to grow in patches of vegetation. Choice A is incorrect because the statement that less than 75% of juvenile plants were found growing in patches of vegetation, while true, doesn’t clearly support the claim that the plants growing in close proximity to other plants gained an advantage at an early developmental stage. Saying that less than 75% of plants were found in patches doesn’t indicate how the percentage growing in patches compares with the percentage that would be expected to grow in patches on the basis of chance alone, which is the information necessary to evaluate whether the claim in the text has support in the table. Put another way, if the percentage of plants found growing in patches was 15% or less, it would be true that less than 75% were found in patches, but the data would in fact weaken the claim in the text, not strengthen it, since the data would show that growing in patches wasn’t advantageous. Choice B is incorrect because only 12 plants of this species were found growing in patches, which was the lowest number of any species, not the greatest number. Additionally, even if it were true that this species had the greatest number of plants growing in patches, the finding would be irrelevant to the claim that plants of all five species gained an advantage by growing in close proximity to other plants. Choice C is incorrect because 59.1% of the plants of these species were found growing in patches, which is a far greater percentage, not a lower percentage, than what would be expected if plants were randomly distributed (around 15%). Additionally, if it were true that the percentage of plants growing in patches was lower for these species than what would be expected from chance alone, that finding would weaken, not strengthen, the claim that growing in patches is advantageous."

Grimes successfully used the golden shovel method to achieve her goal for One Last Word . | C. Langston Hughes and Georgia Douglas Johnson are two of Grimes’s favorite poets. | D. Grimes inspired many other writers to create poems using the golden shovel method.,B,"Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Nikki Grimes’s poetry collection One Last Word . The text explains that Grimes used a writing method called the golden shovel to create the poems in her book. According to the text, the method involves basing a new poem on a line from an existing poem. The text then mentions Langston Hughes and Georgia Douglas Johnson as examples of important Black poets whose lines of poetry form the basis of Grimes’s poems. The text goes on to say that this writing method is difficult and that the resulting poems can be awkward, but reviewers have positively reviewed Grimes’s book. If the reviewers of One Last Word specifically note that the work is a “beautiful and powerful tribute to the poets who inspired it,” then they must have appreciated how Grimes used the golden shovel method to pay tribute to other poets. This suggests that Grimes was successful in using the golden shovel method to achieve her goal of honoring Black poets in her book. Choice A is incorrect because the reaction suggests that most reviewers did understand Grimes’s goal for her book. According to the text, the reviewers noted that the poems in her book were a “beautiful and powerful tribute to the poets who inspired it.” Earlier, the text claims that Grimes intended the poems “to honor important Black poets of the past,” so in their praise of her book, the reviewers clearly indicated that they understood Grimes’s goal. Choice C is incorrect. Although it’s likely that Grimes sought to honor Hughes and Johnson in her book of poetry because they’re among her favorite poets, this fact isn’t suggested by the reviewers’ positive reaction to her book. Instead, the reaction suggests that Grimes was successful in her use of the golden shovel method. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t discuss whether other writers were inspired by Grimes to use the golden shovel method in their poetry. The text mentions the poets Hughes and Johnson as examples of poets honored in Grimes’s book and describes reviewers’ positive reception of her book, but it doesn’t detail Grimes’s impact on other writers."

The text says that many ecologists have assumed that since domed nests provide protection from weather conditions, songbird species that build such nests should be able to have larger geographic ranges than songbird species that build open nests do. If Medina and her colleagues found that species that build open nests tend to have larger geographic ranges than species that build domed nests do, their finding would show the opposite of what the ecologists have assumed. It would therefore challenge the ecologists’ assumption. Choice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that there’s a relationship between songbird species’ extinction rates and their geographic ranges. The finding that species that build open nests tend to have higher extinction rates than species that build domed nests do would therefore have no clear bearing on the ecologists’ assumption that domed nests allow species that build them to have larger geographic ranges than those of species that build open nests.

The finding that species that build open nests tend to be smaller in size than species that build domed nests are would therefore have no clear bearing on the ecologists’ assumption that domed nests allow species that build them to have larger geographic ranges than those of species that build open nests. Choice C is incorrect because although the text indicates that many ecologists have assumed that there’s a connection between how songbird species build their nests and the species’ geographic ranges, the text says that this assumption is based on the shape of the nests—that is, whether the nests are domed or open—not the number of materials used.

According to the text, there are craters in Arabia Terra that could be the result of volcanic activity, and researchers have found evidence of ash deposits consistent with a large eruption. The text goes on to note, however, that erosion and other events could have altered the surface of Mars. This observation suggests that current conditions on Mars’s surface are not necessarily a reliable guide to past events—some signs of past events could have been transformed or erased entirely—and thus the current makeup of Arabia Terra may not accurately reflect past volcanic activity. Choice B is incorrect because the text suggests only that past events could have changed Mars’s surface such that its current appearance isn’t a reliable guide to past activity, not that it’s likely that past eruptions were not as massive as astronomers previously believed. Nothing in the text supports a conclusion about the likely size of past eruptions. Choice C is incorrect because the observation that resurfacing events could have changed the appearance of Mars doesn’t imply that the ash discussed in the text likely came from multiple volcanoes. Although it’s possible that the ash came from different volcanoes, there’s no information in the text supporting a conclusion about how likely that possibility is. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the Arabia Terra craters had to have been created by something other than volcanic eruptions.

The Sumerians solved this problem by using river water for their farming—as a result, they often harvested more crops than were needed in a season. It follows that the Sumerians must have needed to find something to do with the surplus crops—that is, they stored the extra crops for later use.

The text states that the origins of the recipe for red velvet cake ""are unclear."" The text then presents four different entities that claim to have created the first red velvet cake recipe: a Dallas bakery (1860s), the Adams Extract Co. (1930s), a US hotel (1930s), and a Canadian department store (1930s). Lastly, the text states that ""no clear evidence has emerged to favor one of these claims over the others."" Given this information, it most logically follows that it’s not possible to determine who baked the first red velvet cake, as there is insufficient evidence to determine which claim, if any, is correct. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t provide information indicating that red velvet cake existed before the 1860s. According to the text, the earliest claim for creating red velvet cake comes from a bakery in Dallas, Texas, that asserted it developed the first recipe for the cake at the time of the bakery’s opening in the 1860s. There’s no textual support for the conclusion that the cake existed before this earliest claimed date, since the text presents only competing claims starting from the 1860s and extending to the 1930s without evidence of earlier origins. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t support the conclusion that none of the supposed inventors of red velvet cake likely invented the cake. The text states that multiple entities claim to have invented the recipe and that ""no clear evidence has emerged to favor one of these claims over the others."" This lack of decisive evidence doesn’t logically lead to the conclusion that all the claims are false; it merely indicates that the cake’s true origins can’t be determined with the available evidence. The text leaves open the possibility that one of the claimants could indeed be the actual inventor.

The text explains that the Cantares Mexicanos contains poems about the Aztec Empire from before the Spanish invasion. Furthermore, it indicates that notes in the collection attest that some of these poems predate the Spanish invasion, while some customs depicted are likely Spanish in origin. The implication is that some poems were composed before the invasion but the references to Spanish customs could have come about only after the invasion, and thus that the collection includes content that predates the invasion and also content from after the invasion. Choice B is incorrect because the text clearly indicates that the collection is in Nahuatl, not Spanish, so the compilers’ unfamiliarity with Spanish is irrelevant to whether the collection contains material composed after the Spanish invasion.

The text explains that although synthetic aptamer molecules can be used to test for foodborne bacterial pathogens because they bind to target molecules, it hasn’t been clear how likely it is that they will indicate a negative result when a target pathogen is absent in real-world foods. The text then indicates that Somvanshi et al. created test paper that changes from pink to purple when aptamers in it bind to a particular strain of E. coli bacteria, O157:H7, and tested it with store-bought pear juice (that is, a real-world food); the paper changed to purple when exposed to juice to which the target pathogen E. coli O157:H7 had been added, but it remained pink when exposed to juice treated with other E. coli strains or other bacteria species. Based on this result, it seems the aptamers in the paper successfully bound to the target (O157:H7) and the tests had a high degree of specificity (providing negative results for samples where the target was absent even though other bacteria were present) when applied to a real-world food. Choice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that E. coli O157:H7 differs from other pathogens in a way that makes it more suitable for aptamer-based testing of any kind and that specificity is likely to be lower when aptamer-based tests target other bacteria; the text simply indicates that Somvanshi et al. used O157:H7 as the target for aptamer-based test paper in their study and suggests that the paper had a high degree of specificity. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that the specificity of aptamer-based tests in real-world foods is uncertain for pathogens broadly, not just for E. coli , and similarity between strains (of E. coli or of other pathogens) isn’t mentioned. Moreover, the results presented in the text suggest that aptamers are actually capable of distinguishing between strains of E. coli , since Somvanshi et al.’s paper turned purple when exposed to E. coli O157:H7 and remained pink when exposed to other strains. Choice C is incorrect because the text suggests that the aptamers in the test papers didn’t bind to different strains of E. coli . The text explains that the test papers turn purple when the aptamers bind to the targeted pathogen and that in the pear juice tests, the test papers turned purple when exposed to samples with the targeted strain of E. coli (O157:H7) but remained pink when exposed to samples with other strains of E. coli . In other words, the aptamers bound only to the targeted strain, not to the other strains. Further, specificity would be affected if the aptamers had bound to multiple strains and not just the targeted one; that result would cause the specificity to be low."

The text explains that one group of scientists thinks the tusk may help narwhals detect the threat of freezing water and that Laidre disagrees with that idea, given the importance of avoiding a dangerous situation. It’s logical to suggest that if the tusk serves such an important purpose for narwhals, the trait would be more common among them—specifically, that more narwhals would have a tusk. Choice A is incorrect because there’s no reason to think Laidre would say that if the tusk has the important function of helping narwhals detect when the water around them is about to freeze (meaning that it isn’t always freezing), some narwhals would choose a different habitat altogether. Indeed, if it’s true that the tusk helps narwhals avoid areas with dangerous conditions when they occur in their Arctic Ocean habitat, the tusk would likely enable the narwhals to continue living in that habitat rather than drive them elsewhere entirely. Choice B is incorrect because the text focuses only on narwhals and makes no mention of other marine animals or how having a tusk might affect them. And if anything, it would be more logical to expect a very important trait to be more widespread, not less common, among other similar types of animals. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text describes narwhals as shy, it doesn’t indicate that the scientists’ conclusion has anything to do with shyness. And because shyness and detection of the threat of freezing water aren’t logically connected, there’s no reason to think that Laidre would expect narwhals to become less shy over time if the tusk serves that important purpose."

For each candidate species, the table lists its common name, scientific name, and when the species became extinct. The text explains that scientists pursuing de-extinction for the candidate species also consider the length of time that has passed since the species’ extinction, noting that the longer the animal has been extinct, the less likely it is that a suitable habitat would exist for the species today. The possibility of not having a suitable habitat would be especially concerning for the candidate species for which the most time has passed since its extinction. According to the table this species would be the saber-toothed cat, which became extinct 11,000 years before present. Choice A is incorrect because it compares the time since the extinction of the passenger pigeon to the time since the extinction of the huia instead of citing the species listed in the table that has been extinct the longest (the saber-toothed cat). The text indicates that the longer a species has been extinct, the lower the chances are that a suitable habitat exists for it today. Neither the table nor the text supports the claim that the passenger pigeon is especially vulnerable to this problem. Choice C is incorrect because the text states that the longer a species has been extinct, the less likely it is that there would be a suitable habitat available for the species today. So, the problem would be especially concerning for the saber-toothed cat, which became extinct several thousand years before the woolly mammoth did—not the other way around. Choice D is incorrect because the text states that the longer a species has been extinct, the lower the chances are that a suitable habitat would be available for that species today.

In the 1970s, American painter Jack Whitten built a 12-foot (3.7-meter) tool he named the “developer” to apply paint to an entire canvas in one motion, resulting in his series of “slab” paintings from that decade. Whitten described this process as making an entire painting in “one gesture,” signaling a clear departure from the prevalence of gestures in his work from the 1960s. Some art historians claim this shift represents “removing gesture” from the process. Therefore, regardless of whether using the developer constitutes a gesture, both Whitten and these art historians likely agree that ______ blank",Which choice most logically completes the text?,A. any tool that a painter uses to create an artwork is capable of creating gestures. | B. Whitten’s work from the 1960s exhibits many more gestures than his work from the 1970s does. | C. Whitten became less interested in exploring the role of gesture in his work as his career progressed. | D. Whitten’s work from the 1960s is much more realistic than his work from the 1970s is.,B,"Choice B is the best answer. ​​Whitten thinks the tool made “one gesture” paintings, while historians think the tool “removed gesture” from the process completely. But putting that debate aside, both Whitten and the historians would agree that the paintings he made with the tool in the ’70s have way fewer gestures than his paintings from the ’60s, in which gestures are “prevalent,” meaning widely and extensively present. Choice A is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported. The text only discusses the “developer”—it never mentions other tools. Choice C is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported. If anything, the text suggests the opposite: that Whitten became more interested in exploring the role of gesture in his work as his career progressed, as his earlier paintings had many gestures, and his ’70s paintings only had “one gesture.” Choice D is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported. The text never discusses the “realism” of Whitten’s art."

The text explains that after the Galleria dell’Accademia began offering online tours, there were concerns that if people viewed these virtual tours, they would consider an in-person visit to be unnecessary. The finding that many visitors who were surveyed indicated that the virtual tours actually convinced them to plan an in-person visit directly contradicts these concerns. Rather than deterring in-person visits, virtual tours actively encouraged them, providing strong support for the administrators’ claim that the initial concerns were unfounded. Choice B is incorrect. The finding that most surveyed visitors were unaware of the virtual tours before their first in-person visit wouldn’t directly address whether virtual tours affect decisions about in-person visits. This finding would only indicate that these particular visitors didn’t have the opportunity to be influenced by virtual tours when making their decision to visit. Choice C is incorrect because the geographic location of visitors wouldn’t address the impact of virtual tours on people’s decisions to visit the museum in person. Whether visitors live in Florence or elsewhere would suggest nothing about whether virtual tours influenced their choice. This information is irrelevant to the administrators’ claim about the relationship between virtual tours and in-person visits.

The text indicates that these dialects share a feature: putting emphasis on the ""r"" sound when it appears in certain positions in words. The text goes on to state that records indicate the Upland South was colonized largely by people of Scottish ancestry. It is reasonable to assume that the English dialects spoken by these colonizers were influenced by the English dialects spoken by their ancestors in Scotland. It follows, then, that the emphasis on the ""r"" sound in the dialects in Scotland carried over into the Upland South dialects as they developed—that is, that the Upland South dialects likely acquired it from dialects spoken in Scotland. Choice B is incorrect because the text suggests that Scottish ancestry explains the origin of the emphasis on the ""r"" sound in English dialects spoken in the Upland South, since that linguistic feature is also found in dialects spoken in Scotland; the text doesn’t address any other dialects or suggest that the feature will spread elsewhere. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that many Upland South colonizers were the descendants of Scottish people, suggesting that the English dialects spoken by these colonizers had been influenced by the English dialects spoken by the colonizers’ ancestors in Scotland and had acquired their emphasis on the ""r"" sound from those ancestors’ dialects—not the other way around.

The table shows the approximate rates at which five languages are spoken and the rates at which those five languages convey information. Vietnamese is spoken at around 5.3 syllables per second, whereas Spanish is spoken at around 7.7 syllables per second, but the two languages convey information at very similar rates: Vietnamese at a rate of around 42.5 bits per second and Spanish at a rate of around 42.0 bits per second. Thus, the description of Vietnamese conveying information at around the same rate that Spanish does despite being spoken more slowly supports the claim in the text that languages can convey the same amount of information even if spoken at different rates.

After establishing that Buck views most people “as nothing,” the text explains that Buck won’t acknowledge people other than Thornton unless they appear friendly toward Thornton, and even then he’s only reluctantly accepting. Thus, the text focuses on the idea that Thornton has a special status in Buck’s mind, with Buck holding him in higher regard than other people. Choice A is incorrect because the text conveys that Buck isn’t social with people other than Thornton but doesn’t address Buck’s life or temperament before he lived with Thornton. Choice B is incorrect because the text conveys that Buck doesn’t really care about people other than Thornton and is aloof toward them. However, there’s no indication that Buck mistrusts and avoids people generally; indeed, he accepts Thornton, who is a human. Choice C is incorrect because the text refers to random travelers praising and petting Buck and Thornton’s partners giving Buck favors, but there’s no indication that any of these people are Thornton’s friends or that they have a particular fondness for Buck."

Geoffrey of Monmouth’s accounts of Arthurian legends in his History are more similar overall in content to the accounts in Culhwch and Olwen than they are to the accounts in Roman de Brut. | D. the Arthurian legends that the author of Vita Sancti Cadoci drew on would not have featured the Round Table.",D,"Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the discussion about the genealogy of Arthurian legends. The text establishes a chronology of Arthurian sources, with Vita Sancti Cadoci composed in the 11th century (the 1000s), Geoffrey of Monmouth’s History written in the 1130s, Wace’s Roman de Brut in 1155, and Culhwch and Olwen in the second half of the 12th century (1150–1200). Importantly, the text indicates that along with adapting Geoffrey’s History , Wace added ""the famous Round Table"" to it. If Wace introduced the idea of the Round Table in 1155, it logically follows that this element was not present in earlier works. This suggests that the Arthurian legends that informed Vita Sancti Cadoci , which was written before both Geoffrey’s and Wace’s works, would not have featured the Round Table. Choice A is incorrect because the text discusses several works that include legends about a character, King Arthur, but doesn’t address the historical accuracy of the stories in those works or suggest that the creation of Culhwch and Olwen was relevant to any other works’ accuracy. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that works containing stories of the Round Table were available to Geoffrey of Monmouth when he composed his History in the 1130s, whether he was aware of them or not; it instead suggests that the idea of the Round Table wasn’t introduced until more than a decade later, when Wace added it to Geoffrey’s History .

This critic challenges the claim by arguing that A History of Mexico is not so idiosyncratic (unique) as to resist classification because its use of Maya-style human profiles actually “invites classification as Indigenous art.” Therefore, according to this critic, the work can be viewed, at least partially, through a lens of national or cultural identity. Choice A is incorrect. While it describes the Maya influence on a particular aspect of A History of Mexico , this quotation doesn’t push back on Medellín’s “idiosyncratic” (unique) style, nor does it try to categorize the entire work into a single cultural tradition.

It suggests that the work effectively blends a variety of artistic products to create a single work that can’t be defined by any one tradition. Instead, the work recalls many centuries of history and culture all at once. Choice C is incorrect. This choice supports rather than challenges the underlined claim. The quotation argues that other critics focus too much on Indigenous influences on the artwork instead of viewing all of the influences equally—that they should instead be viewing the work as an idiosyncratic whole instead of through one or two narrow cultural lenses."

The text goes on to state that artificial-leaf technology ""is not yet commercially viable as a large-scale energy source"" and that scientists from several fields are doing additional research to refine the technology. Thus, the main idea is that continued research and development in artificial-leaf technology is needed before the devices can be widely used as an energy source. Choice B is incorrect. While the text does state that scientists from many fields are researching artificial leaves, they’re doing so to address the fact that the leaves are not yet commercially viable, rather than in response to an increase in commercial use.

The text indicates that the cupid is near a statue of a female figure who is fishing, and it goes on to indicate that because Venus is associated with cupids, some scholars believe the female figure to be the goddess Venus. But the text then says that, according to archaeologist Carla Brain, cupids may have also been associated with the activity of fishing, which, if true, would suggest that the mere appearance of a cupid near a female figure engaged in fishing does not indicate with certainty that the figure is Venus (that is, the cupid might be associated with fishing, and the figure might be anyone at all).

The text describes a study assessing how children think of rewards and fairness and its results. It concludes that the children in the study may have thought that a teacher who counted out loud when giving rewards cared more about fairness than a teacher who did not count out loud. Choice A is incorrect. The children in the study are described as being “four to six,” and the text doesn’t mention any differences among the different ages. Choice B is incorrect.

French people with significant foreign investments were unlikely to have the right to vote.,A,"Choice A is the best answer. We’re told that people needed to pay “at least 300 francs in direct taxes” to be able to vote. We’re also told that, while “relatively few people paid the tax on real estate,” real estate taxes were both the main way people qualified to vote and the main source of revenue for the government. Based on this, we can infer that those who did qualify to vote likely had significant French real estate holdings. Choice B is incorrect. The passage doesn’t mention the voting habits of artisans and merchants nor any reduction in tax burdens on businesses, so there’s no basis for this inference. Choice C is incorrect. Although we know that doors and windows were taxed during the Bourbon Restoration, we don’t have enough information to infer if doors and windows increased after this time. Choice D is incorrect. Although we know that foreign investments were only minimally taxed, we don’t have enough information to determine if those with significant foreign investments were unlikely to have voting rights.

The text indicates that the people in the crowd are roaring and shouting “Bread!” or “Taxes!” and presents them as not knowing what they really want. The Lord Chancellor’s response is to ask what their shouting means but also to observe that they’re shouting with “unanimity,” or total agreement. Clearly, this isn’t the case, which supports the statement that the Lord Chancellor describes the crowd as being united even though it’s not. Choice A is incorrect because it isn’t supported by the text. Although the text indicates that the Lord Chancellor asks about the meaning of the crowd’s shouting, it doesn’t suggest that he knows what the crowd really wants. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that the Lord Chancellor wants to speak to the crowd. Furthermore, the text doesn’t indicate that the crowd wants to hear from the Sub-Warden. Although the crowd roars when asked “Who roar for the Sub-Warden?” it’s unclear what the roaring means.

The table shows the values for the estimated harmful impact of three invasive predator species (mongooses, dogs, and cats) on threatened birds, mammals, and reptiles. The text states that the values are on a scale from 0.25 (less impact) to 1.00 (greater impact). The table shows that the value for the estimated impact of invasive mongooses on threatened mammals is 0.75. Choice A is incorrect because the table shows that the value for the estimated impact of mongooses on threatened mammals is 0.75, not 0.35. The value 0.35 is not assigned to any of the categories in the table. Choice B is incorrect because the table shows that 0.61 is the value for the estimated impact of cats, not mongooses, on threatened mammals.

Although many believe that only modern humans developed systems for notating numbers, one archaeologist asserts that this artifact may be a sign that Neanderthals also recorded numerical information. The notches on the bone are unevenly spaced but approximately parallel, and microscopic analysis reveals that they were made with a single stone tool; according to the archaeologist, this suggests that the notches were all made at one time by one individual as a means of counting something.","Which finding, if true, would most directly weaken the underlined claim?",A. Parallel lines are a common feature in modern humans’ early systems for recording numerical information. | B. More than nine approximately parallel notches made with a different stone tool are present on another artifact found at a site in western France. | C. It would have taken careful effort to make evenly spaced lines on bone with the stone tools typically used by Neanderthals. | D. Decorative art discovered at another Neanderthal site in western France primarily features patterns of unevenly spaced parallel lines.,D,"Choice D is the best answer. The archeologist bases their claim on the fact that the hyena bone features unevenly spaced parallel notches. But if unevenly spaced parallel lines were found on ""decorative art"" at another Neanderthal site, it would suggest that the hyena bone is probably decorative art as well—not a counting tool. Choice A is incorrect. This choice doesn’t weaken the underlined claim. If anything, it might actually strengthen the claim: assuming we can make an inference about Neanderthals using a fact about early humans, it provides more support for the idea that the person who made the notches was counting something. Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn’t weaken the underlined claim. The fact that another artifact had parallel notches made with a different stone tool doesn’t tell us anything about the use of either artifact. For all we know, they could both have been used for counting. Choice C is incorrect. This choice doesn’t weaken the underlined claim. The fact that it took effort to make the lines doesn’t tell us anything about what the lines were for."

The text states that Holme ""did not like to be interrupted"" while reading Gibbon and that he considered interruptions to be ""an insult."" Furthermore, the text suggests that Gibbon is Holme’s favorite author because, as the text states, ""he was always reading Gibbon."" Thus, Holme would have felt annoyed at having been interrupted when the letter was delivered. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that Holme is relieved to receive the letter. Instead, the text states that Holme ""just glanced indifferently at the letter,"" suggesting that the letter wasn’t important to him.

Instead, the text states that Holme didn’t put down his book to receive the letter and that he looked at the letter ""indifferently"" and at the postman ""impatiently."" This suggests that Holme isn’t excited. Also, there is no mention that Holme knows who sent the letter.

The text explains how Chinese immigrants in New York City tend to settle in different boroughs based on their region of origin in China: those from north China (Mandarin speakers) typically settle in Queens, while those from south China (Cantonese or Fuzhounese speakers) typically settle in Manhattan. This pattern demonstrates that the regional language distribution in China (north versus south) has reproduced itself in New York City (Queens versus Manhattan). Therefore, it can be reasonably inferred that correlations between languages and regions in one country can replicate themselves when citizens of that country emigrate to a new country. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t discuss rates of language change. The text indicates that many languages are spoken in New York City, but it doesn’t provide any information about how quickly these languages might be changing, either in relation to each other or compared to areas where fewer languages are spoken. Choice B is incorrect because the text provides no information about changes in vocabulary or pronunciation of immigrant languages compared to their original forms. The text only discusses where different groups of language speakers tend to settle, not how their languages might have evolved after immigration. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t provide any information about a relationship between a country’s physical size and the number of languages spoken there. While the text mentions that over 600 languages are spoken in New York City, it doesn’t relate this to the physical size of New York or the United States, nor does it suggest that large countries like China have more languages than geographically smaller countries."

In the quotation, Du Bois explains that for his entire life, Black folk songs “stirred [him] strangely.” Even though they originated in the South, a region he wasn’t familiar with, he knew the songs “as of me and of mine.” That is, he identified strongly with them and associated them with his community.

Although the quotation considers the cultural and spiritual value of Black folk music, it doesn’t establish that this music inspired in Du Bois a sense of cultural recognition. Choice C is incorrect because this quotation addresses the cultural survival of Black folk songs despite attempts to caricature, or parody, them, not Du Bois’s sense of cultural connection to them.

The speaker describes an evening scene observed from a boat: ""little lights in little ports come out"" and are reflected in the water’s surface ""with the stars,"" fishing boats are moored, ""sails are furled"" (rolled up), and the riding-light is shining. The speaker emphasizes the calmness of the scene, noting that the ""race of wind is stilled"" and the atmosphere is sleepy (""slumbrous waters pool a slumbrous world""), and then indicates that the calmness prompts thoughts of how old age might be ""sweet"" and ""quiet"" and ""gracious in retreat"" after ""a windy youth"" with ""storms."" Thus, the main idea is that the tranquility of a port in the evening can lead a person to appreciate the potential stillness of old age. Choice B is incorrect because the speaker isn’t discussing the difficulty of bringing a ship into port but describing the calmness of the port at night. And rather than suggesting that old age involves struggles, the speaker suggests that after ""a windy youth"" with ""storms"" to be weathered, old age will be ""sweet,"" ""quiet,"" and ""gracious""—that is, old age will be tranquil like a port at night.

The text indicates that in the fly D. melanogaster , DptA and DptB are genes that encode peptides that both fight pathogens and promote beneficial microbes. Researchers tested D. melanogaster ’s resistance to P. rettgeri and A. sicerae bacteria based on which variation of the peptide-encoding gene the flies exhibit: DptA silenced (referred to as type A), DptB silenced (type B), or both silenced (type AB). The text also indicates that resistance to P. rettgeri correlates with DptA activity but not with DptB activity (which would manifest as type B flies surviving at a higher rate than other fly types when exposed to P. rettgeri ). The graph shows the post– A. sicerae infection results, which indicate that DptB activity was most strongly associated with survival, whereas DptA activity was not (manifesting in the graph as the type A flies having greater survival rates than the other fly types). In other words, when DptA activity was silenced, the flies showed relatively high survival rates, but when DptB activity was silenced, whether on its own or in conjunction with DptA activity being silenced, survival rates were low, suggesting that DptB may have developed as a specific defense against A. sicerae . Choice A is incorrect. The graph suggests that DptA activity is associated with a low rate of survival, not a high one. Furthermore, the graph shows results for flies where DptA alone was silenced, DptB alone was silenced, and both were silenced and thus does not show any flies with activity in both DptA and DptB , which would be necessary to determine whether DptA conferred defense against A. sicerae in the presence of DptB . Choice B is incorrect. Only two bacteria species were considered in the text: P. rettgeri and A. sicerae . The text and graph taken together suggest that activity in DptA is associated with resistance to P. rettgeri while DptB activity is not, and that DptB activity is associated with resistance to A. sicerae while DptA is not. There is no further information to suggest one genetic type confers resistance to a greater number of pathogens than the other. Choice D is incorrect. The graph does not address flies with activity in both DptA and DptB . All flies represented in the graph had one or both of DptA and DptB silenced, or inactive."

The text explains that because stars and planets begin forming from the same gas and dust, astronomers believe planets should be composed of the same materials as their host stars, but in equal or smaller quantities. The finding that the amount of iron in some rocky planets is much higher than the amount in their host star would weaken the astronomers’ claim because it would show that some planets contain the same material as their host star, but in higher quantities. Choice A is incorrect because a finding only about the makeup of stars, whether they’ve cooled or not, would provide no information about the makeup of planets. Thus, it wouldn’t have any bearing on the claim that planets and their host stars are composed of the same materials in differing quantities. Choice B is incorrect because a finding about two host stars having similar proportions of certain materials wouldn’t provide any information about the makeup of planets. Thus, it wouldn’t be relevant to the claim that planets and their host stars are composed of the same materials in differing quantities. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that the astronomers’ claim is based on a fact—that stars and planets begin forming from the same gas and dust in space—which would remain true regardless of the effectiveness of a method for analysis of compositions. The text does cite analysis of rocky planets in our solar system and the Sun, but only as a single piece of evidence that is consistent with the claim and not as the source of the claim; the finding that the method used for that analysis is less effective in other scenarios wouldn’t weaken a claim that’s based on knowledge of how stars and planets initially form."

Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t claim that social media is revolutionizing, or fundamentally changing, how sellers and researchers view the fashion industry. The text never addresses the way the fashion industry is viewed; rather, it discusses a practical approach sellers in the industry can take to better match production with demand. Choice C is incorrect. Although avoiding overstocking is mentioned as a benefit of an approach that can help fashion sellers better predict demand, the text doesn’t focus on overstocking or characterize it as the main concern of sellers. Rather, the text is focused on discussing the approach itself. Choice D is incorrect because the text suggests that fashion sellers encounter obstacles when using their own data to try to forecast demand as tastes and styles change; the text focuses on the idea that instead of using their own data alone, retailers should combine their own data with social media information to more accurately forecast demand."

But in one of the experiments, Sevilla and Townsend arranged the same jewelry with different levels of intervening space at an upscale retailer (Tiffany & Co.) and a relatively inexpensive retailer (Forever 21). The result of this experiment suggests that a store context associated with inexpensive products may moderate the effect Sevilla and Townsend observed in their other experiments.","Which finding from the experiment with Tiffany & Co. and Forever 21, if true, would most directly support the conclusion presented in the text?","A.

According to the text, Sevilla and Townsend found in several experiments that when products in a generic retail setting are displayed with a low product-to-space ratio (that is, with lots of space between them), consumers view those products as significantly more valuable than when the same products are displayed with a higher product-to-space ratio (less space between them). The text then states that the results of an experiment specifically using the contexts of an inexpensive store (Forever 21) and an upscale one (Tiffany & Co.) suggest that an inexpensive store context may moderate, or lessen, that effect. If Sevilla and Townsend found that participants in the experiment with Tiffany & Co. and Forever 21 judged the same jewelry items as substantially more valuable when there was lots of space between them than when there was little space between them in the upscale store (Tiffany & Co.) but judged the same jewelry items as only slightly more valuable when there was lots of space between them than when there was little space between them in the inexpensive store (Forever 21), that finding would demonstrate that increased space between products was associated with less of an increase in those products’ perceived value at the inexpensive store than at the upscale store. Thus, the finding would support the text’s conclusion that a store context associated with inexpensive goods moderates the effect Sevilla and Townsend observed in their earlier experiments. Choice B is incorrect because if Sevilla and Townsend found that at both upscale and inexpensive stores, participants judged jewelry spaced far apart to be less valuable than jewelry spaced close together, that would show the opposite of the effect the researchers observed in their earlier experiments, not show that an inexpensive store context merely moderates, or lessens, that effect. Choice C is incorrect because this finding wouldn’t show that the effect Sevilla and Townsend observed in their initial experiments (that products spaced far apart were perceived as more valuable than the same products spaced close together) is present but lessened in inexpensive retail contexts, as the text suggests. The conclusion in the text rests on determining the difference in jewelry items’ perceived value between two spacing conditions within each store and then comparing the difference for the inexpensive store (Forever 21) to the difference for the upscale store (Tiffany & Co.); a finding that compares perceptions of the jewelry items’ value between the two stores but for only one type of spacing condition at a time wouldn’t provide information about the degree of difference between spacing conditions within each type of store context. Choice D is incorrect because this finding wouldn’t show that the effect Sevilla and Townsend observed in their initial experiments (that products spaced far apart were perceived as more valuable than the same products spaced close together) is present but lessened in inexpensive retail contexts, as the text suggests. The conclusion in the text rests on determining the difference in jewelry items’ perceived value between two spacing conditions within each store and then comparing the difference for the inexpensive store (Forever 21) to the difference for the upscale store (Tiffany & Co.); a finding that compares perceptions of the relative value of jewelry items between the two stores and for only one type of spacing condition at a time wouldn’t provide information about the degree of difference between spacing conditions within each type of store context."

According to Davis, the songs sung by Rainey were more musically innovative than those sung by Smith typically were.",C,"Choice C is the best answer because it describes the songs sung by Gertrude ""Ma"" Rainey and Bessie Smith in a way the text implies is accurate. The text describes Angela Y. Davis’s research on Rainey and Smith for her book Blues Legacies and Black Feminism , focusing on her efforts to transcribe the improvised lyrics in Rainey’s and Smith’s songs. The text calls Davis’s transcription process ""labor intensive"" since the lack of clarity in the recordings required her to listen to each repeatedly to verify the accuracy of her transcripts. The fact that Davis undertook a painstaking transcription process using only fairly low-fidelity recordings suggests that reliable transcriptions were otherwise unavailable to her. Choice A is incorrect. The text doesn’t discuss the popularity of Rainey’s and Smith’s songs either in the 1920s or after. Although it is plausible that the music of Rainey and Smith is more widely enjoyed than it was in the 1920s, this isn’t supported by the text. Choice B is incorrect. The text doesn’t discuss which of Rainey and Smith was the more prolific recording artist and so provides no support for such a claim. Choice D is incorrect. The text discusses the creativity of both Rainey and Smith, but it does so only to note similarities between them in terms of improvisation and wit, not to emphasize differences between them or Davis’s relative views of the artists’ inventiveness."

The text states that while consumers expect ever-faster delivery of goods, delivery companies ""continue to struggle with last-mile logistics."" The text further explains that innovations aimed at addressing this challenge have a tendency to cause complications of their own. Because escalating consumer demands for speed are paired with persistent, complex delivery obstacles and new problems arising from attempted solutions, it logically follows that consumer expectations for delivery times may be exceeding what companies can feasibly provide. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t address the idea of delivery volumes at all and makes it clear that companies are already aware of and trying to address consumers’ expectations for delivery. Further, the challenge presented at the end of the text relates to new problems that tend to arise with solutions for logistical problems, not to a lack of understanding of what consumers want or how delivery volumes fluctuate. Choice C is incorrect. The text does suggest that rapid delivery is important for customer satisfaction and thus is a beneficial investment for companies, but that idea is already presented in the beginning of the text and doesn’t logically follow as a conclusion from the information about innovations companies are exploring to solve last-mile logistics problems; the idea that the potential solutions tend to introduce new issues points to the feasibility of meeting consumer expectations, not to the general fact that it would be beneficial to reduce delivery times. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that there may be insufficient incentive for delivery companies to try to solve last-mile logistics problems—on the contrary, the text directly indicates that delivery companies are already actively pursuing innovations to try to address those problems, citing the example of the use of aerial drones, even though the innovations can introduce new complications."

The text begins by explaining that wild animals can be studied in their natural habitat or in a laboratory setting, with each setting offering unique advantages to researchers. The text then highlights an instance in which Western scrub-jays were studied in both settings but with conflicting results, indicating that one or both studies may have failed to account for the disadvantages of its research setting. Thus, the main idea of the text is that while wild animals can be effectively studied in natural or lab settings, there are drawbacks to each that need to be considered to ensure accurate results. Choice A is incorrect because the text does not position one study setting (natural or lab) as superior to the other; rather, the text states that each one has advantages over the other. Choice B is incorrect. The text provides a hypothetical example of two studies in different environments with conflicting results, but this single example cannot be extrapolated to a general claim about the likelihood that results of studies in different environments will conflict. Additionally, the text does not assert anything about how researchers can or cannot resolve conflicting study results.

These details suggest that the banker was very upset. Choice A is incorrect because this quotation mainly describes the banker cautiously unlocking a door; it doesn’t suggest that he was particularly upset about anything.

In this quotation, the speaker notes that as years go by, “Each, coming”—that is, each new year as it comes—“brings ambitions high.” In other words, the speaker begins each new year with large goals. But the speaker goes on to say that as each year ends (“each, departing”), it “leaves a sigh / Linked to the past.” A sigh is an expression of longing or regret, so in the context of the whole quotation, this portion suggests that at the end of each year, the speaker regretfully reflects on not having achieved the ambitions formed at the beginning of the year. The phrases “the years go swiftly by,” “Each, coming,” and “each, departing” indicate that this experience happens over and over again: the speaker experiences a cycle of anticipation followed by regretful reflection. Choice A is incorrect because this quotation does not describe an ongoing cycle of anticipation followed by regretful reflection. Instead, the speaker describes experiencing a sensation similar to fright as a result of something that has occurred at midnight. Specifically, the speaker has heard a “brazen tongue,” a figurative way of saying that the speaker has heard the clang of a bronze bell being rung. Choice B is incorrect because although this quotation does convey a sense of anticipation through its reference to “ominous stillness,” there is no suggestion of regretful reflection or any indication that the speaker is describing an ongoing cycle of anticipation followed by such reflection. Instead, the speaker is describing a particular moment when a winter storm appears to have momentarily calmed. Choice C is incorrect because although this quotation does convey a sense of regret (“many a squandered day”), nothing in the quotation suggests an ongoing cycle of anticipation followed by regret. Instead, the speaker is simply lamenting wasted time and opportunities."

The text explains that Morrison was the first Black woman to be an editor for Random House and that she was an editor there from 1967 to 1983. If it were true that Random House published a higher percentage of works by Black authors throughout the 1970s—during most of Morrison’s time working there—than it had previously published, that would suggest that Morrison may have made a deliberate effort to strengthen the presence of Black authors on the list of Random House’s published authors, thus supporting the scholar’s claim. Choice B is incorrect because the scholar’s claim is about Morrison’s work as an editor at a publishing company and her likely effort to strengthen the presence of Black writers on that company’s list of published authors. It might be true that Black authors interviewed in the 1980s and 1990s often cited Morrison’s novels as an influence on their work, but that finding would simply suggest something about how those authors approached their work; it wouldn’t show that Morrison intended to increase the number of Black writers among the published authors specifically at Random House. Choice C is incorrect because the scholar’s claim is about Morrison’s work as an editor at a publishing company, not about her work as a novelist. Therefore, a finding that Morrison’s novels published after 1983 sold more copies and were more widely acclaimed than her earlier novels would have no bearing on the claim that as an editor Morrison made an effort to ensure that more Black writers were present on Random House’s list of published authors. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text discusses Morrison’s work as an editor at Random House, the scholar’s claim focuses on Morrison’s likely effort in that role to increase the number of Black writers present on Random House’s list of published authors, not on the influence she may have had on the content of the works she edited. Without knowing whether Morrison’s stylistic influence led to more publications or if Morrison applied her influence specifically to works by Black writers, the finding that works edited by Morrison could be identified by stylistic characteristics would have no bearing on the claim that Morrison intended to strengthen the presence of Black writers among the published authors at Random House."

The text first establishes that information coming from credentialed experts typically increases the credibility of that information. However, the text goes on to describe a situation that goes against this expectation: the messages from previous trial volunteers were judged as more credible than the messages from licensed doctors when recruiting clinic trial participants. The text then goes on to speculate as to why this may have been the case, stating that participants likely considered the messages from the former trial volunteers to be more convincing than the messages from the doctors because the former trial volunteers were perceived as having undergone the same experience that the participants were considering. It is reasonable to infer, then, that participants regarded the former trial volunteers’ direct experience as more important to their decision-making than the doctors’ status as credentialed experts. Choice A is incorrect because the text does not provide any indication as to the content or the tone of the messages provided by either the doctors or the former trial volunteers regarding the clinical trials.

The text explains that while desert moss species need sufficient sunlight for photosynthesis, exposure to sunlight can also affect the plants negatively by drying them out. Ekwealor and Fisher’s team found specimens of S. caninervis moss growing under quartz crystals that were semitransparent, allowing some but not all sunlight to pass through them, and the shoot tissue of these specimens was longer than that of S. caninervis specimens found growing on the surface that were unprotected by such crystals. Since, as the text explains, the length of shoot tissue is an indicator of plant growth, and since greater exposure to sunlight results in greater loss of moisture, it can be inferred that S. caninervis growing under quartz crystals experience lower light intensity and are thus able to retain more moisture. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t mention another moss species besides S. caninervis or discuss whether other such species are able to grow under transparent crystals, as S. caninervis is. Choice B is incorrect because, as the text explains, specimens of S. caninervis were found growing under quartz crystals and exhibited more plant growth than specimens growing on the soil surface. This wouldn’t have been the case if the crystals transmitted insufficient light for the moss’s photosynthesis. Choice D is incorrect. The text contrasts the growth of S. caninervis specimens found beneath semitransparent quartz crystals with that of specimens found on the soil surface absent such crystals, but it doesn’t make a comparison among specimens growing beneath crystals of different degrees of thickness or consider how the relative thickness of the crystals affects the growth of the moss."

When the fermented beans were analyzed, they were found to contain two microorganisms, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus plantarum , that are theorized to increase the amount of nitrogen absorbed by the gut after eating beans. | D. Both fermented and nonfermented black beans contained significantly fewer trypsin inhibitors and tannins after being cooked at high pressure.",B,"Choice B is the best answer because it presents a finding that would best support Granito and Álvarez’s claim that fermenting black beans makes them easier to digest and more nutritious. The text indicates that high levels of soluble fiber and raffinose in black beans make the beans hard to digest and that tannins and trypsin inhibitors make it harder for the body to extract nutrients from the beans. If it were found that fermenting the beans significantly reduces their levels of soluble fiber, raffinose, trypsin inhibitors, and tannins when cooked, this would directly support the claim that fermentation improves the digestibility of the beans and makes them more nutritious. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that trypsin inhibitors and tannins interfere with the body’s ability to extract nutrients from black beans; if fermentation and cooking were found to increase these antinutrients, fermented beans would likely be less nutritious than unfermented ones, not more nutritious (as Granito and Álvarez claim). Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t address the idea that greater nitrogen absorption in the gut has an effect on a food’s digestibility or level of nutrition, so the discovery of the presence of microorganisms that may increase nitrogen absorption wouldn’t provide relevant support for the claim that fermentation makes black beans easier to digest and more nutritious. Choice D is incorrect because Granito and Álvarez’s claim focuses on the effect of fermenting black beans, but the finding that nonfermented black beans also have fewer trypsin inhibitors and tannins when cooked at high pressure would suggest that the role of the cooking method could be significant when it comes to nutrition; further, the finding wouldn’t address the beans’ digestibility."

Research on this phenomenon has tended to focus on philanthropic gifting by London’s largest guilds; for her part, Kilburn-Toppin focuses on the gifting of handmade objects and fixtures (such as decorative paneling or plasterwork) within the craft guilds, which were “composed of highly discerning producers and consumers of material cultures.” Given this characterization, it can reasonably be inferred that the gifting of such objects may have ______ blank",Which choice most logically completes the text?,A. ensured that knowledge of the materials and techniques used by members of the craft guilds stayed within the craft guilds. | B. emphasized ostentatious offerings in the case of the largest guilds and prosaic objects in the case of the craft guilds. | C. functioned as a way for craft guild members to maintain and enhance their professional reputations among their peers. | D. conferred greater social status when the recipient belonged to one of London’s largest guilds than when the recipient belonged to a craft guild.,C,"Choice C is the best answer because it logically completes the text’s discussion of the role of gift giving among members of guilds in early modern London. According to the text, members of these guilds participated in a culture where giving gifts ""both signaled and conferred social status""—that is, it indicated people’s social standing and also gave them social standing—and occurred in the forms of both philanthropic gifting (donations for humanitarian purposes) by large guilds, which much research has focused on, and the gifting of handmade items between craft guild members, which Kilburn-Toppin focuses on. The text indicates that Kilburn-Toppin characterizes craft guild members as people who made and consumed items and were ""highly discerning,"" or were careful judges of quality. Because gift giving benefited one’s status and if craft guild members were particularly attentive to quality, it follows that gifting handmade items within the guilds—between people who had high standards for items they made and for items they received—may have been a way for members to maintain and enhance their professional reputations, or their professional statuses, among their peers. Choice A is incorrect because the text emphasizes the idea that members of guilds participated in gift giving both to display and receive social status, suggesting that the gifting of handmade items between the ""highly discerning"" members of craft guilds had to do with the members’ interest in quality and status; nothing in the text suggests that the practice of gifting those items within the craft guilds was intended to limit knowledge of materials and techniques to the members of those guilds. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t distinguish between ""ostentatious,"" or very showy, and ""prosaic,"" or ordinary, gifts and because the characterization at the end of the text pertains specifically to the gifting of handmade items indicative of great taste, not prosaic items, between members of craft guilds. And while the text indicates that London’s largest guilds gave philanthropic gifts (donations for humanitarian purposes), it doesn’t indicate whether these gifts would have been considered ostentatious. Choice D is incorrect because the characterization presented at the end of the text pertains specifically to the ""highly discerning"" members of craft guilds giving their handmade items as gifts to one another within the craft guilds; the text doesn’t suggest anything about gifting those items to members of London’s largest guilds or how that might affect status differently from giving them to other craft guild members."

The table contains information about the right ascensions, periods, and frequencies of various pulsar stars called RRATs. According to the text, the period of an RRAT is defined as the time between consecutive pulses. The table shows that the period of RRAT J0614-03 is 0.136 seconds, which is the lowest number of all the periods of the RRATs listed in the table. If the period is the time between consecutive pulses, and J0614-03 has the shortest period, then J0614-03 has the shortest amount of time between consecutive pulses of all the RRATs in the table.

Borrowers use their business proceeds to repay loans in equal weekly installments and incur no penalty for missed payments other than lack of access to larger loans. Economists Gustavo Barboza and Sandra Trejos analyzed ALSOL data and found that rural borrowers, who mostly make and sell handicrafts, miss payments more often than urban borrowers do, partly because they sell their goods less frequently than they could.

The cost to rural entrepreneurs to bring their goods to towns with marketplaces is high but largely independent of the number of goods they bring.",D,"Choice D is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most directly support Barboza and Trejos’s claim that rural female entrepreneurs who have received small loans from ALSOL are strategic in selling their goods less frequently than they could, even if it means missing payments. The text explains that borrowers in the ALSOL program use proceeds from their businesses to repay loans in equal weekly payments, with almost no penalty for missed payments. According to the text, Barboza and Trejos found that rural borrowers miss weekly payments in part because they don’t sell their goods as often as they could, a move the researchers claim allows the entrepreneurs to help increase profits for the goods they sell. Finding that the cost of bringing goods to towns with marketplaces is high for rural entrepreneurs but is largely independent of how many goods are brought would support the researchers’ claim: traveling to marketplaces less frequently would mean that a rural entrepreneur spends less on travel overall, and taking a large load of goods to a marketplace for essentially the same cost as taking a small load would allow the entrepreneur to more substantially offset the cost of travel with greater overall sales at the marketplace, resulting in more profit per good sold—even if those profits are earned less frequently and don’t support weekly loan payments. Choice A is incorrect because the finding that many marketplaces require entrepreneurs to pay the operators of the marketplace a fixed percentage of proceeds to be able to sell goods there wouldn’t explain why rural entrepreneurs strategically choose to sell their goods less frequently than they could in order to increase their profits per unit sold. With a fixed percentage of proceeds due to operators, the amount entrepreneurs have to pay operators would also be fixed regardless of frequency of selling. Choice B is incorrect because the finding that rural entrepreneurs can usually sell their goods for higher prices in cities than in their local areas but also face higher competition to sell goods in cities wouldn’t explain why rural entrepreneurs strategically choose to sell their goods less frequently than they could in order to increase their profits per unit sold. This is because both the higher prices and higher competition in cities would be stable factors—meaning there would be no clear reason for the rural entrepreneurs not to take every available chance to sell their goods in cities and to instead sell their goods in cities only sometimes. Choice C is incorrect because the finding that rural entrepreneurs have lower costs and thus tend to require smaller initial loans than urban entrepreneurs do has no bearing on rural borrowers strategically choosing to sell their goods less frequently than they could specifically to increase their profits per unit sold. The cost of producing goods doesn’t depend on the frequency with which an entrepreneur sells those goods, so lower frequency alone wouldn’t affect profits, and the initial loan amount is set and has nothing to do with how much profit is earned from each sale."

The text indicates that scientists have long thought that giraffes produce little sound and exclusively rely on visual signals to communicate with one another. The text goes on to say, however, that Stöger and her team have recorded giraffes in three European zoos making a low-pitched humming sound, which the team claims the giraffes use to communicate when they cannot see each other.

The text provides no information about whether researchers have even attempted to record low-pitched humming in wild giraffes, so nothing can be concluded about the implications of the lack of such recordings. Choice D is incorrect because finding that other animals in European zoos had been observed humming would not support Stöger and her team’s claim, since it would not indicate anything about why giraffes produce humming sounds.

The text states that data gathered by the Curiosity rover suggest that bodies of water deposited sediment on Mars’s surface long ago. The text goes on to say that studying the sediment, Rivera-Hernández et al. found some coarse grains they believe are sandstone, which tends to be left by flowing water, and many more fine grains they believe are mudstone, which tends to slowly sink in low-flow water. The text further indicates that the researchers noted cracks in the fine grains that suggest there were cycles of desiccation, or drying, at the site. Taken together, this information suggests that a lake (a body of low-flow water) existed at the site for a prolonged period but occasionally experienced drying and that there were periods in which one or more streams (flowing water) were present, since the extended existence of a lake would account for the abundance of fine grains, periods of drying would account for the cracks in the fine grains, and periods with streams would account for the sections of coarse grains. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that an abundance of fine grains of sediment was found at the Murray Formation site, which suggests that a low-flow water source (such as a lake) was present. Further, the text makes no mention of where the water at the site may have originated from.

Choice D is incorrect. Although the text suggests that both a low-flow body of water (such as a lake) and flowing water (such as streams) existed at the Murray Formation site, meaning that there could have been a stream-fed lake, the text explains that the fine grains that signify the presence of a lake exhibit cracking that indicates periods of desiccation, or drying, which suggests that a lake was present but did occasionally dry out."

Some archaeologists have expressed concern that they might be replaced by such computer models, but the researchers claim that outcome is highly unlikely.","Which finding, if true, would most directly support the researchers’ claim?","A. In the researchers’ study, the model was able to categorize the pottery fragments much more quickly than the archaeologists could. | B. In the researchers’ study, neither the model nor the archeologists were able to accurately categorize all the pottery fragments that were presented. | C. A survey of archaeologists showed that categorizing pottery fragments limits the amount of time they can dedicate to other important tasks that only human experts can do. | D. A survey of archaeologists showed that few of them received dedicated training in how to properly categorize pottery fragments.",C,"Choice C is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would support the researchers’ claim that archaeologists are unlikely to be replaced by certain computer models. The text explains that although archaeologists hold that categorizing pottery fragments relies on both objective criteria and instinct developed through direct experience, researchers have found that a computer model can categorize the fragments with the same degree of accuracy as the humans can—a finding that has caused some archaeologists to worry that their own work won’t be needed any longer. If survey results indicate that categorizing pottery fragments limits the amount of time archaeologists can dedicate to other important tasks that only human experts can do, that would mean that computer models aren’t able to do all of the important things archaeologists do, thus supporting the researchers’ claim that computer models are unlikely to replace human archaeologists. Choice A is incorrect because if it were true that the computer model could categorize the pottery fragments much more quickly than the archaeologists could, that would weaken the researchers’ claim that archaeologists are unlikely to be replaced by certain computer models, since it would demonstrate that the models could conduct the archaeologists’ work not only with equal accuracy but also at a faster pace. Choice B is incorrect because the inability of both the computer model and the archaeologists to accurately categorize all of the pottery fragments presented wouldn’t support the researchers’ claim that archaeologists are unlikely to be replaced by certain computer models. The text indicates that some archaeologists are worried because the computer model’s accuracy is equal to their own, and that could be the case whether both were perfectly accurate or were unable to achieve complete accuracy. Choice D is incorrect because survey results showing that few archaeologists received special training in properly categorizing pottery fragments wouldn’t support the researchers’ claim that archaeologists are unlikely to be replaced by certain computer models. The amount of special training in categorizing pottery fragments that archaeologists have received has no direct bearing on whether computer models’ success at categorizing fragments will lead to the models replacing the archaeologists."

According to the text, in service of AACM’s goal to support new works by Black musicians, AACM mentors provide beneficial training and guidance to young artists. The text goes on to say that many other art organizations support new artists in similar ways, suggesting that these organizations recognize the importance of providing opportunities for young artists to learn from mentors who are established in their field. Choice A is incorrect because the text gives no indication that technical training is more beneficial than creative guidance. The text states that AACM mentors offer both technical training and creative guidance to young artists and that other arts organizations offer similar kinds of support; however, nothing in the text suggests that young artists, or artists of any age, benefit more from technical training. Choice C is incorrect because the text is mainly concerned with the fact that established artists are mentoring young artists through AACM and other arts organizations. The text states that young musicians benefit from AACM mentors but does not address what mentors gain from the relationship, so there is no reason to conclude that most established artists could improve as artists by serving as mentors. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text indicates that mentors are beneficial to young musicians and that young people pursuing other kinds of art (including painting and writing) can also find mentors through arts organizations, the text gives no indication that mentors are more important for musicians than for other types of artists."

In their 2022 study, Miyu Umehara and colleagues discovered that an x-ray computed tomography (CT) scanner can accurately record a burrow’s measurements both at a moment in time and throughout the entire burrow-building process, something that’s impossible with resin casting because ______ blank",Which choice most logically completes the text?,A. it can only be used on burrows below a certain size. | B. it does not allow for multiple castings of the same burrow over time. | C. the casting process takes more time than A. bellulus takes to construct a burrow. | D. the process of recovering the model distorts the resin’s shape.,B,"Choice B is the best answer. Since resin casting “inevitably requires destroying the burrow,” it would be impossible to make multiple castings of the same burrow over time. Choice A is incorrect. The passage doesn’t discuss size requirements for completing resin casting, so there’s no basis for this inference. Choice C is incorrect. The passage never mentions how long the casting process takes nor how long A. bellulus takes to construct a borrow, so there’s no basis for this inference. Choice D is incorrect. The passage never states that recovering the model distorts the resin’s shape, only that it destroys the burrow. Therefore, there’s no basis for this inference."

Some experts have claimed that the type of wood used to create Cremonese violins is responsible for their prized sound, but modern and Cremonese violins are made of the same kinds of wood: maple and spruce. New analysis, however, has revealed unique indications that the wood in the older violins was chemically treated by the makers, leading researchers to suggest that ______ blank",Which choice most logically completes the text?,"A. Cremonese violins probably were not considered superior to other instruments at the time they were made. | B. the sound quality of Cremonese violins results in part from a method the craftspeople used to alter the wood. | C. if modern violins were made of a wood other than maple or spruce, they likely would sound as good as Cremonese violins. | D. the current process of making violins is the same process that was used centuries ago by Cremonese craftspeople.",B,"Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the sound quality of Cremonese and modern violins. The text states that violins made in Cremona in the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries sound superior to modern violins. It then indicates that some experts attribute the difference to different woods being used to make these violins, but both Cremonese and modern violins are made of the same woods (maple and spruce); thus this cannot account for the difference. The text then says that recent analysis suggests the wood in Cremonese violins was chemically treated by the craftspeople who made them, thereby providing an alternate explanation for the sound differences: the chemical alteration that is present in the Cremonese violins but absent from the modern ones. Choice A is incorrect because the text does not discuss how the sound quality of Cremonese violins compares with the sound quality of other instruments made during the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries. Instead it focuses on how the sound of the Cremonese violins compares with that of modern violins. Choice C is incorrect. The text states that there are differences in sound quality between the Cremonese and modern violins, and that both types of violin are made with maple or spruce. Thus the type of wood alone does not determine a violin’s sound quality. Furthermore, even if the type of wood alone could account for differences in sound quality, the text makes no mention of other woods, so there is no basis to judge how modern violins would sound if they were made using woods besides maple and spruce. Choice D is incorrect because the text states that there is evidence that Cremonese craftspeople chemically treated the wood used in Cremonese violins. This evidence is attributed to “new analysis,” which strongly suggests that this process was unknown to modern violin makers before that analysis. If the chemical treatment was unknown until recently, the manufacturing process for modern violins must differ with respect to the previously unknown practice of chemically treating the wood."

In this context, to say that Dingle’s baskets are “handmade from” particular plants means that Dingle creates baskets herself using those plants but without using machines. The text says that Dingle “skillfully winds” parts of palmetto palm plants around sweetgrass plants to make baskets with an appearance that “no factory can reproduce.” This context suggests that Dingle’s baskets are handmade from sweetgrass and palmetto palm. Choice A is incorrect because the text describes how Dingle uses sweetgrass and palmetto palm to create her baskets, not how her baskets are “indicated by,” or signified by, sweetgrass and palmetto palm. Choice C is incorrect. Although Dingle’s baskets are described as being made using sweetgrass and palm, there’s nothing in the text to suggest that the baskets are “represented by,” or exemplified or portrayed by, sweetgrass and palmetto palm. Instead, the focus of the text is on Dingle’s use of sweetgrass and palmetto palm and the impossibility of replicating the appearance of her baskets using machines.

As used in this context, ""transformed"" means substantially changed in some way. The text states that the invention radically altered the semiconductor industry, with some historians claiming that it had a fundamental effect on the industry by allowing for mass production for the first time. This context conveys that the invention of the integrated circuit transformed the semiconductor industry. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text indicates that the invention of the integrated circuit significantly affected (""radically altered"") the semiconductor industry, it doesn’t indicate that the invention ""overwhelmed"" the industry, which in this context would mean that it overcame the industry such that the industry struggled or was defeated. Instead, the text conveys that the invention’s effect was positive, since it allowed the semiconductor industry to begin making use of mass production methods. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to say that the invention of the integrated circuit ""bypassed"" the semiconductor industry, which would mean it intentionally avoided the industry. The text indicates that the invention directly affected the semiconductor industry, since it made it possible for the industry to begin engaging in mass production methods.

The text first notes that maple trees already thrive in a wide variety of climates and then goes on to say that alterations maples may undergo are likely to be relatively small and easily achieved. This context supports the idea that maple trees will more easily adjust or adapt to a changing climate. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text discusses how maple trees adjust to change, the trees do not ""relocate from,"" or physically move from one place to another.

A lonely | B. A disagreeable | C. An acceptable | D. An extraordinary,D,"Choice D is the best answer because as used in the text, “singular” most nearly means extraordinary. The text portrays an experiment in which a character rehydrates a dried rose by infusing it with moisture. After prolonged contact with the liquid, the rose begins to absorb it, undergoing an exceptional transformation: its color deepens, its previously “crushed and dried” petals shift, and the entire flower revives “from a deathlike slumber.” In other words, an extraordinary change is visible in the flower. Choice A is incorrect. Although in some contexts “singular” can mean of or relating to an individual or to a single instance of something, this usage doesn’t imply loneliness or an otherwise unsatisfactory condition of isolation. Moreover, the text doesn’t attribute such a condition to the rose. Choice B is incorrect. Although “singular” has several related meanings, none of them relate to being disagreeable or unpleasant.

Choice A is incorrect. ""Proficient"" means ""skilled."" Du Bois and Locke are contrasted with Johnson, but nothing in the text suggests that Johnson was not skilled at making editorial decisions. Based on the text, the three editors just have different styles; they’re not necessarily more or less skilled. Choice C is incorrect.

It illustrates a reaction that audiences typically have to the appearance of characters created by computer animators.,A,"Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the function of the underlined question in the text as a whole. The text begins with the underlined question, “How lifelike are they?” The text then explains that many computer animators pose this question about the environments and lighting that they create for animated films, striving for realistic animation of those components even if the characters themselves aren’t portrayed in realistic terms. The focus of the text then shifts to describe how some animators strive to create environments and lighting that reflect the film’s unique stories rather than making them appear realistic. Therefore, the function of the underlined question is to reflect a primary goal that many computer animators have for certain components of the animations they produce. Choice B is incorrect because, as the text makes clear, the underlined question is one posed by computer animators who wish to create realistic backgrounds and lighting effects, not by those who, instead, wish to create effects that reflect films’ unique stories and aren’t necessarily realistic; this latter group of animators is discussed later in the text. Choice C is incorrect. As the text explains, many computer animators strive for realistic environments and lighting, while others do not; this difference of approach relates to whether these components should be realistic, not to how realism can be achieved using current technology, and the text never suggests that animators are uncertain how to achieve it.

The text then indicates that such processes have been seen in mammals but that researchers have recently observed similar processes involving dopamine in honeybees. Taken together, this information serves to sum up the discovery that some mechanisms in the brains of certain insects may resemble mechanisms linked to feelings such as pleasure and displeasure in mammals.

The text focuses on drivers who think the current toll for the Lewis and Clark Bridge is too high, suggesting that advocates for increasing that toll would have better success presenting their arguments to ""a more persuadable segment of the population"" rather than to those drivers. This context suggests that the drivers who strongly believe the toll is already too high are not persuadable—that is, that they are unlikely to be willing to consider the toll-increase proposal. Choice B is incorrect because ""apprised of"" means informed about or made aware of something, and nothing in the text suggests that the drivers who think a toll is already too high wouldn’t be informed of a proposal for an even higher toll; in fact, the text implies that advocates of the proposal would ""direct their arguments"" in favor of the increase to those drivers, even though they would likely be more successful focusing on people who are more open to hearing their arguments. Choice C is incorrect. In this context, ""incensed by"" would mean angered or outraged by something. The text focuses on drivers who feel that a current toll is too high, and it wouldn’t make sense to suggest that those drivers would be unlikely to be angered by a proposal for the toll to be increased; indeed, drivers who think the toll is already too high likely would be angered by a move to raise it even higher. Choice D is incorrect. In this context, ""cited in"" would mean referred to or mentioned in something.

Economist Trevon Logan showed, however, that a close look at the available data disproves this supposition.",Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?,A. surmised | B. contrived | C. questioned | D. regretted,A,"Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century household food purchases. In this context, “surmised” means formed an idea or assumption with little evidence. The text explains that certain economic historians “assumed” that large and small households spent different amounts on food per person, but that another economist found this supposition to be false based on evidence from available data. This context suggests that the economic historians made an incorrect assumption without enough consideration of evidence. Choice B is incorrect. In this context, “contrived” would mean brought about or created through trickery. Nothing in the text suggests that the economic historians were deliberately trying to trick people with a claim about food purchasing behaviors in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century households; the text simply suggests that they made an assumption about those behaviors that another historian believes isn’t supported by the available data. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that it’s Logan and not the economic historians who “questioned,” or doubted, the assumption that large and small households in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries spent different amounts on food per person; the economic historians are the ones who made that assumption to begin with. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that some economic historians “regretted,” or felt sad or remorseful about, the food purchasing behaviors of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century households. The text focuses on the idea that the economic historians made an assumption about those behaviors that may not be supported by available data, not on the historians’ emotional response to what households did in the past."

Disorganized | B. Alarmed | C. Offended | D. Interrupted,B,"Choice B is the best answer because as used in the text, “disturbed” most nearly means alarmed. The text portrays the narrator traveling in a carriage as wolves howl in the surrounding darkness. The text contrasts the reaction of both the narrator and the horses pulling the carriage with that of the driver of the carriage: the narrator and horses are “dreadfully afraid,” but the driver is “not in the least disturbed.” In other words, the driver is not alarmed by the wolves nearby. Choice A is incorrect. Although in some contexts, “disturbed” can mean disorganized, the text doesn’t portray a character acting in a disorganized manner; instead, the driver continues to drive the carriage, even though the horses pulling it are alarmed. Choice C is incorrect. Although in some contexts, “disturbed” can mean offended, the text doesn’t portray one character feeling offended, or upset, by another’s actions; instead, it contrasts the fear felt by the narrator with another character’s lack of fear. Choice D is incorrect. Although in some contexts, “disturbed” can mean interrupted, the text doesn’t portray an action being interrupted; indeed, the travel depicted in the scene continues despite the threat of the wolves outside the carriage."

In this context, ""rectify"" means to correct or remedy something undesirable. The text indicates that by chartering the St. Luke Penny Savings Bank in 1903, Walker took action to provide local Black residents with greater access to financial services like home loans and savings opportunities. This context supports the idea that she aimed to rectify the undesirable situation affecting these residents. Choice A is incorrect because in this context, ""prolong"" would mean to lengthen something in time. The text indicates that at the turn of the twentieth century, Black residents in Richmond, Virginia, were faced with a lack of formal banking options. The text then states that Walker founded a new bank that provided these residents with financial services. Therefore, instead of prolonging the situation, she took steps to rectify, or correct, it.

According to the text, at the turn of the twentieth century, Black residents in Richmond, Virginia, had few formal banking options, and Walker chartered a new institution to provide these residents with expanded financial services; therefore, she took steps to rectify, not retain, the situation. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, ""highlight"" would mean to emphasize or call attention to something, but the text indicates that Walker took concrete steps beyond merely drawing attention to the situation Black residents were facing in Richmond, Virginia, at the turn of the twentieth century.

Christina Albers in 1910). Shakti is walking near a riverbank that she visited frequently during her childhood. She crossed the woods she knew so well. The trees seemed to extend their branches like welcoming arms. They greeted her as an old friend. Soon she reached the river-side.,Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?,A. It suggests that Shakti feels uncomfortable near the river. | B. It indicates that Shakti has lost her sense of direction in the woods. | C. It emphasizes Shakti’s sense of belonging in the landscape. | D. It conveys Shakti’s appreciation for her long-term friendships.,C,"Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The first sentence of the text states that Shakti knows the woods she is walking in well. The next sentence, which is underlined, emphasizes Shakti’s familiarity with, and sense of security within, the woods by describing how the tree branches are friendly and “welcoming,” as they are depicted as extending open arms to her. The remainder of the text also shows that Shakti is comfortable and content in the woods by describing her as “an old friend” of the trees. Thus, the function of the underlined portion is to emphasize Shakti’s sense of belonging in the wooded landscape that she visits. Choice A is incorrect because the text and underlined portion suggest that Shakti is comfortable, not uncomfortable, in her surroundings: the trees around her are described as welcoming and reassuring. Moreover, the underlined portion discusses Shakti’s feelings in the forest, not the river, since she hasn’t reached the river yet. Choice B is incorrect because the text and underlined portion emphasize Shakti’s familiarity with the woods. The trees are inviting, and she feels like “an old friend” to the woods, so she isn’t lost or confused there. Choice D is incorrect because the third sentence uses the phrase “as an old friend” figuratively in reference to Shakti’s sense of familiarity with the landscape, not in reference to her long-standing friendships with other people, and the text and underlined portion never discuss her feelings about such friendships."

In this context, “concede” means to admit something is true after first resisting that admission. The text indicates that some researchers believe “Bronze Age societies were ruled by men.” But the Bronze Age burial of a woman at El Algar included “valuable objects signaling a high position of power,” which would raise the possibility that “women may have also held leadership roles.” Thus, the text is calling into question the notion that only men were leaders in these societies and speculating that people holding this view may reconsider their opinion. Choice A is incorrect because “waive” means to refrain from insisting that something, such as a right or a requirement, be observed; the word isn’t used, however, in contexts where someone acknowledges that an opinion they hold may be invalid, as is the case in the text. Choice C is incorrect. According to the text, the finding from the El Algar burial site undermines the view that Bronze Age societies were exclusively ruled by men. However, “refute” means to demonstrate that something is false and would not make sense in context. Lull and team’s finding supports the view that women may have also held leadership roles, not that they did not participate in such roles. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, “require” means to demand or specify as mandatory. However, it would not make sense for contemporary researchers to demand that Bronze Age “women may have also held leadership roles.”"

When people try to make joint decisions like this, they often don’t reveal their true preferences.

Text 2 Research shows that people who don’t state their preferences when making a decision with others aren’t more likable in the eyes of others. In fact, stating that you have no preference actually makes the decision more difficult for other people.

Cancel the plan to have lunch together. | B. Ask where the friend typically likes to eat. | C. State a preference about where to eat. | D. Change the subject to talk about something else.,C,"Choice C is the best answer because it directly applies the research findings described in Text 2 to the situation underlined in Text 1. The underlined sentence in Text 1 describes a common scenario in which two friends are deciding on a lunch location. Text 1 goes on to explain that people often don’t reveal their true preferences in such situations, instead claiming they’re fine with any option so that they can appear more easygoing and likable. Text 2 presents research that advises against this approach, stating that people who don’t express their preferences aren’t viewed as more likable and that this behavior actually makes decisions more difficult for others. Since Text 2 specifically argues against the strategy of concealing preferences and indicates negative outcomes from doing so, the author of Text 2 would most likely recommend stating a preference about where to eat. Choice A is incorrect because nothing in Text 2 suggests that canceling plans is a good solution. The author of Text 2 is addressing how to make joint decisions effectively (through stating your own preference), not advocating for avoiding such decisions entirely. Choice B is incorrect because asking where the friend typically likes to eat still avoids stating one’s own preference. While this approach might seem considerate, it continues the pattern of not revealing true preferences that Text 2 identifies as problematic. Choice D is incorrect because changing the subject would avoid making any decision altogether, which contradicts the implied advice in Text 2. The author of Text 2 presents research suggesting that directly engaging with the decision by stating preferences helps others make decisions and makes you appear more likable."

The text begins by summarizing the main conclusion of the study conducted by Paul Hanel and colleagues: when confronted with ideas they disagree with in discussions about controversial topics, people are more likely to respond politely if they think about their personal values before engaging in such discussions. The text then goes on to describe the design of Hanel and colleagues’ experiment. By comparing interactions between members of an experimental group (who had been prompted to write about their personal values beforehand) to those between members of a control group (who had been prompted to write about a beverage), the team found that people in the experimental group behaved more civilly, or politely, than people in the control group did during discussions about a controversial topic. This finding led to the conclusion described at the beginning of the text. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text discusses the results of a study, it doesn’t provide any indication that the conclusion the study supported—that when facing disagreement, people behave more politely when they have thought about their values—is a belief that is widely held. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t indicate that the researchers found the results of their study to be surprising, or contrary to what they expected. In fact, there’s no indication provided in the text about how the researchers felt about the study’s results or that the results should be considered surprising. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text discusses the experimental design of a study, it doesn’t suggest any improvements to that design; instead, it focuses on how the design enabled the researchers to draw a particular conclusion."

To demonstrate that the factors that motivated the start of the Great Migration were different for Black women than they were for Black men | D. To provide an overview of the employment challenges faced by Black women in the agricultural and domestic spheres in the southern United States",A,"Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the text’s purpose, which is to discuss the important role Barrier Williams played in supporting many other Black women as they relocated to the northern United States during the early years of the Great Migration. After introducing Barrier Williams, the text describes how she helped find jobs for other Black women, who in many cases relocated in search of better employment prospects than the South could offer at the time. The text indicates that by doing so, she eased these women’s transition as their circumstances changed. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text mentions Barrier Williams’s work as a political activist and writer for the Chicago Defender , it doesn’t discuss any professional connections she made in these roles or indicate that she used any such connections in her work to secure employment for other Black women. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text discusses a factor that caused many women to relocate during the Great Migration, their difficulty finding employment in the South, the text doesn’t indicate that this factor motivated the start of the Great Migration. Moreover, the text doesn’t discuss the factors that motivated Black men to migrate. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text mentions the difficult employment prospects for Black women in the domestic and agricultural sectors in the South during the Great Migration, the text’s main purpose isn’t to provide an overview of the employment challenges Black women faced in these sectors.

Dugdale Sykes disputed claims that The Two Noble Kinsmen was coauthored by William Shakespeare and John Fletcher. Sykes felt Fletcher’s contributions to the play were obvious—Fletcher had a distinct style in his other plays, so much so that lines with that style were considered sufficient evidence of Fletcher’s authorship. But for the lines not deemed to be by Fletcher, Sykes felt that their depiction of women indicated that their author was not Shakespeare but Philip Massinger. Text 2 Scholars have accepted The Two Noble Kinsmen as coauthored by Shakespeare since the 1970s: it appears in all major one-volume editions of Shakespeare’s complete works. Though scholars disagree about who wrote what exactly, it is generally held that on the basis of style, Shakespeare wrote all of the first act and most of the last, while John Fletcher authored most of the three middle acts.","Based on the texts, both Sykes in Text 1 and the scholars in Text 2 would most likely agree with which statement?","A.

Text 1 states that Sykes felt Fletcher’s contributions to the play were obvious because he had a distinct style in his other plays. Text 2 states that scholars generally agree “on the basis of style” that Fletcher wrote most of the three middle acts. Both texts imply that Fletcher’s writing has a unique, readily identifiable style that can be used to distinguish his work from others. Choice B is incorrect. While Text 1 refers to the women in Massinger plays, neither text compares the women of Fletcher’s plays to the women of Massinger’s plays. Text 2 doesn’t mention Massinger at all. Choice C is incorrect. Text 1 states that Sykes disputed that Shakespeare coauthored the play, and implied that it was coauthored by Fletcher and Massinger instead. Sykes, therefore, would disagree that The Two Noble Kinsmen belongs in a Shakespeare compilation. Choice D is incorrect.

The general design was now obvious to the common eye.","As used in the text, what does the word “assumed” most nearly mean?",A. Acquired | B. Acknowledged | C. Imitated | D. Speculated,A,"Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, “assumed” most nearly means acquired, or came to possess. The text portrays a character named Drowne carving a figure out of wood. At first “irregular and misty,” or haphazard and indistinct, the figure’s outline gradually showed “distincter grace and beauty” until the general design of the carved object “was now obvious to the common eye,” or plainly recognizable to anyone. In other words, as Drowne continued to carve, the wooden object came to possess, or acquired, greater precision, changing from an indistinct outline or shape into a graceful, beautiful, and clearly recognizable form. Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts “assumed” can mean acknowledged, or recognized, it doesn’t have that meaning in this context because an inanimate object like the wooden figure can’t acknowledge its own precision. Choice C is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that the wooden figure merely imitated, or mimicked, precision. Rather, the text suggests that as Drowne carved his wooden figure, it gradually became more precise. Choice D is incorrect.

In this context, ""featured"" means shown prominently. The text focuses on where Hernandez’s works have been and continue to be displayed, explaining that her early works, which consisted of murals, could be viewed in outdoor spaces in San Francisco. The central contrast developed in the text is between where her early works could be viewed and where her works can be viewed now, which is in museums across the United States and around the world. The context therefore supports the idea that Hernandez’s works are now shown, or featured, in museums globally. Choice A is incorrect because in this context ""invented"" would mean created something for the first time, which isn’t supported since the text doesn’t discuss where Hernandez creates her works or whether they’re original or innovative. Choice B is incorrect because ""adjusted"" in this context would mean adapted. Although the text mentions that many of Hernandez’s early works were outdoor murals and thus it may be reasonable to infer that Hernandez altered her approach to creating art so that her works could be displayed in indoor venues instead, the text makes no mention of how Hernandez’s works might have been adapted for such venues. The text focuses on where Hernandez’s works have been and continue to be displayed, not on how she or anyone else may have adapted, or adjusted, her works.

To evaluate a scholarly work that offers explanations for the impact of urban fashion ideals on Black female farmworkers in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Texas | D. To summarize the findings of a study that explored factors influencing a fashion practice among Black female farmworkers in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Texas,D,"Choice D is the best answer. The text provides an overview of a scholarly work discussing the fashion practices of Black female farmworkers in late 19th- and early 20th-century Texas, and how these practices were influenced by both the fashion ideals of the time and the demands of farmwork. Choice A is incorrect. The text never discusses the rate of fashion change among Black female farmworkers. The text also never categorizes Flewellen’s findings as ""unexpected."" Choice B is incorrect. The text actually explains that Black female farmworkers were trying to achieve traditional feminine ideals, not resist them. Choice C is incorrect. The text doesn’t evaluate a scholarly work but rather simply describes it. Furthermore, the text is focused on ""agricultural and domestic"" fashion, not urban fashion as this choice suggests."

To describe how each step of the peer review process unfolds,C,"Choice C is the best answer because it best describes the main purpose of the text, which is to explain why a certain rap album is particularly innovative. The text mentions rap artist and professor A.D. Carson, who published ""the first peer-reviewed rap album."" The text also describes the unusual process of having the work evaluated by both scholars and rap artists before its release, and details how the album combines elements of a mixtape album with elements of scholarly essays. All of these characteristics of the album and the way in which it was developed help to demonstrate the album’s novelty. Choice A is incorrect because though the text mentions an album that combines elements of scholarly essays and mixtapes, it does not compare the relative public impact of scholarly articles and albums. Choice B is incorrect because the text does not present the opinion of a scholar regarding the rap album. Choice D is incorrect because though the text mentions that the album was peer reviewed, it does not detail the steps of the review."

In this context, ""embraced"" means accepted or adopted readily. The text begins by identifying Cat and Plum Blossoms as an example of Nihonga , or classical (that is, traditional) Japanese painting. The text continues by drawing a contrast between Hishida’s work and Kuroda Seiki’s work, which differs from that of Hishida in its use of the traditional European method of using oil paints on canvas rather than using traditional Japanese approaches. The text then concludes with an example of one such traditional Japanese painting technique exemplified by Hishida’s Cat and Plum Blossoms —applications of color pigments to a silk scroll—to further develop the contrast between the two artists’ approaches. This context supports the idea that Hishida adopted, or embraced, traditional Japanese approaches. Choice A is incorrect because in this context ""distrusted"" would mean that Hishida was skeptical of or lacked confidence in traditional Japanese approaches to painting. The text begins by stating that Hishida’s painting Cat and Plum Blossoms is an example of Nihonga , or traditional Japanese painting, and then cites Hishida’s application of color pigments to a silk scroll as an instance of a traditional Japanese painting technique. It therefore wouldn’t make sense to say that Hishida’s use of traditional Japanese painting techniques indicates his distrust, or skepticism, of them. Rather, it suggests that he embraced those techniques. Choice C is incorrect because saying that Hishida ""released"" traditional Japanese approaches to painting in this context would mean that he freed them from any restrictions. In using Hishida’s application of color pigments to a silk scroll in Cat and Plum Blossoms as an example of a traditional Japanese approach to painting found in Nihonga , the text strongly implies that Hishida followed these approaches, not that he removed them from any restrictions. Choice D is incorrect because in this context ""overlooked"" would mean ignored or failed to notice. The text establishes that Hishida’s painting Cat and Plum Blossoms is a notable work of Nihonga , or classical Japanese painting, that features the traditional technique of applying color pigments to a silk scroll. It wouldn’t make sense to say that Hishida’s use of a traditional Japanese approach to painting indicates that Hishida failed to notice those approaches."

It identifies the problem that Nance and colleagues attempted to solve but did not. | D. It explains how the work of Nance and colleagues was received by others in the field.,C,"Choice C is the best answer because it best describes how the second sentence functions in the text as a whole. The first sentence establishes something astronomers believe with some certainty: that Betelgeuse will explode in a supernova. The second sentence then introduces a problem: astronomers aren’t certain when Betelgeuse will explode because they don’t have enough information about the star’s internal characteristics. Finally, the third sentence indicates that researcher Sarafina El-Badry Nance and colleagues investigated a possible method of obtaining the necessary information about Betelgeuse’s internal characteristics, though they found that the method wouldn’t be sufficient. Thus, the function of the second sentence is to identify the problem that Nance and colleagues attempted to solve but didn’t. Choice A is incorrect because the second sentence introduces the general problem Nance and colleagues hoped to solve, not a serious limitation of how Nance and colleagues tried to solve it. It is the third sentence that introduces Nance and colleagues, but no serious limitation of their approach to studying a method of determining internal stellar states is described. Choice B is incorrect because the second sentence introduces the general problem Nance and colleagues hoped to solve, not the central finding they ultimately reported. It is the third sentence that presents Nance and colleagues’ conclusion that a potential method for determining internal stellar states would be insufficient. Choice D is incorrect because the second sentence doesn’t indicate how other astronomers or astrophysicists responded to the work done by Nance and colleagues; the text doesn’t address this information at all."

In this context, ""successful"" means accomplishing a goal or purpose. According to the text, conservationists planted more than 500,000 native trees in an Azores bullfinch habitat in order to boost the bird’s population size. The text then indicates that the population size did indeed grow as a result of the planted trees. Thus, in this context, the conservationists’ approach of planting native trees was successful because it achieved the goal of increasing the bird’s population size. Choice A is incorrect because the text gives no indication that the conservationists’ approach of planting native trees to increase Azores bullfinch’s numbers was ""amusing,"" or comical or entertaining. Instead, the approach was seriously undertaken and ultimately accomplished. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t address how much it cost to achieve the goal of planting native trees to increase Azores bullfinch’s numbers. The text indicates that the approach was beneficial and successful rather than ""costly,"" or expensive or harmful. Choice D is incorrect. According to the text, the conservationists’ approach of planting native trees to increase Azores bullfinch’s numbers was beneficial and successful rather than ""disastrous,"" or damaging or unsuccessful."

In this context, ""corroborate"" means confirm or support with evidence. The text indicates that one possible explanation for the relationship being discussed is that practitioners may overlook confounding variables—that is, additional factors other than the medical interventions being investigated that affect the observed outcomes. This means that practitioners may assume that an outcome is the direct result of a medical intervention when it is actually the result of a combination of factors. Clinical trials take steps to rule out factors other than the one being studied, so if those extra factors are actually having an effect on real-world outcomes, the trials are likely to produce conclusions different from those practitioners reach in their real-world observations. In other words, clinical trials may fail to corroborate practitioners’ conclusions. Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that the results of clinical trials could ""circumvent,"" or find a way around or bypass, conclusions practitioners reach in real-world scenarios with patients; it’s possible that researchers conducting the trials might avoid engaging with practitioners’ conclusions, but findings from a study can’t choose to get around something. Choice C is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that the results of clinical trials could ""disseminate,"" or spread widely, conclusions practitioners reach in real-world scenarios with patients; the researchers conducting the trials might choose to draw attention to practitioners’ conclusions, but findings from a study can’t spread anything. Choice D is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that the results of clinical trials could ""implement,"" or put into effect, conclusions practitioners reach in real-world scenarios with patients; the researchers conducting the trials might consider practitioners’ conclusions, but findings from a study can’t put anything into effect."

In this context, ""optimize"" means make the most effective possible use of available opportunities. The text indicates that though businesses typically try to promote themselves, they don’t always make use of effective tools for doing so, pointing to research showing that 33 percent of restaurants failed to use a free listing service that increased revenue by 5 percent on average for restaurants that did use the service. The text therefore suggests that by foregoing a free and effective marketing tool, some businesses aren’t making the best use of, or optimizing, marketing opportunities. Choice A is incorrect because in this context, ""adorn"" would mean decorate or enhance the appearance of, and there’s nothing in the text to suggest that by failing to use a free and effective promotional tool, some businesses aren’t enhancing the appearance of their own marketing. The example in the text illustrates that some businesses aren’t utilizing an effective marketing opportunity, not that they aren’t improving the appearance of their marketing. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, ""endorse"" would mean openly approve or recommend, and the text’s discussion of the fact that some businesses have overlooked an effective marketing tool doesn’t support the idea that those businesses therefore don’t approve of their own marketing. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, saying that businesses don’t ""counteract"" their marketing would suggest that they don’t actively undermine it or make it ineffective. The text begins by stating that businesses typically try to promote themselves but then continues to imply that some businesses fail to take advantage of good opportunities to do so, citing the example of businesses that failed to use a free and effective marketing tool. Though it’s possible that those businesses that did use the site therefore didn’t unintentionally counteract their own marketing, the first sentence conveys that the text’s focus is on things that some businesses do and that some businesses don’t do when trying to promote themselves, and it wouldn’t make sense to say that any businesses would actively try to undermine their own marketing in pursuit of that goal."

As used in this context, “speculates” would mean puts forward an idea without firm evidence. The text states that Ochoa “doesn’t have a definite idea” about when humans might need to live in other environments and characterizes Ochoa’s prediction as a “conjecture,” or a conclusion presented without convincing evidence. This context indicates that Ochoa speculates when she makes this prediction. Choice A is incorrect because saying that Ochoa “demands,” or insists or requires, that humans will one day need to live in other environments than Earth’s would not make sense in context.

This context conveys not only that the measurements differed from predictions but also that the extent of the difference was very large. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text indicates that there was a very large difference between the predicted mass and the actual measured mass of the subatomic particle, it doesn’t explain the cause of, or reason behind, that difference.

In this context, “inexperienced with” means not accustomed to. The text indicates that Flores Rivera wanted to promote the Quechua language in her music and overcame a challenge by seeking help with pronunciation from her grandmother and by taking language classes. This context conveys the idea that Flores Rivera was not sufficiently familiar with Quechua to use it in her music without help. Thus, she was inexperienced with speaking the language, which she addressed by seeking help. Choice A is incorrect because describing Flores Rivera as “prepared for”—or ready for—speaking Quechua wouldn’t make sense in context. The text indicates that speaking Quechua presented a challenge, but if she were ready to speak the language, then there would be no challenge.

In this context, ""irrelevant"" means not applicable to the matter at hand. The text explains that as a matter of logical reasoning, the source of a claim has nothing to do with the claim’s truthfulness—a claim is either true or false in actuality, regardless of where it originates. This context suggests that even though people may distrust a claim based on its source, the source of the claim is actually irrelevant. Choice A is incorrect because in this context, ""indistinct"" would mean uncertain or not clearly recognizable. Instead of suggesting that the source of a claim can’t be determined with certainty, the text suggests that recognizing a source and having an opinion of it simply doesn’t matter because as a matter of logic, a claim is true or false in actuality, regardless of where it originates. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, ""indisputable"" would mean impossible to question or deny. Although the text suggests that it isn’t logical to assume a claim is false just because its source appears to be self-interested, it doesn’t go so far as to suggest that the source of a claim can’t be questioned—the text instead makes the point that from a logical standpoint, the source of a claim doesn’t matter because the claim is either true or false in and of itself. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, ""implicit"" would mean suggested or understood without being directly expressed. Nothing in the text suggests that logically, the source of a claim is only suggested; instead of addressing whether sources can be directly identified, the text focuses on the idea that sources don’t matter because a claim is true or false in actuality, regardless of where it originates."

As used in this context, “repudiates” means rejects or refuses to have anything to do with. The text indicates that television shows tend to depict Native characters as living long ago, but that Harjo’s series Reservation Dogs focuses on Native teenagers in the present day, representing a “rejection” of the typical approach to depicting Native characters. This context thus indicates that Harjo repudiates television’s general tendency regarding Native characters. Choice B is incorrect because the text describes Harjo’s “rejection” of the typical approach to representing Native characters on television, so it wouldn’t make sense to say that Harjo “proclaims,” or declares or affirms, television’s general tendency regarding Native characters. Harjo is described as refusing to follow the pattern of depicting Native characters in the distant past, not as proclaiming that pattern. Choice C is incorrect because the text describes television’s tendency to represent Native characters in the distant past as something that is already occurring, not as something that Harjo “foretells,” or predicts will happen in the future. The text is focused on Harjo’s “rejection” of this pattern, not on any predictions he may have about it. Choice D is incorrect because saying that Harjo “recants” something would mean that he withdraws a previously held belief, and it wouldn’t make sense to say that Harjo recants television’s tendency to represent Native characters as living in the past. No beliefs previously held by Harjo are mentioned. Additionally, a tendency isn’t a belief and thus isn’t something that can be recanted."

The narrator’s family owned a zoo when he was a child. It was a huge zoo, spread over numberless acres, big enough to require a train to explore it, though it seemed to get smaller as I grew older, train included. ©2001 by Yann Martel","As used in the text, what does the word “spread” most nearly mean?",A. Hidden | B. Discussed | C. Extended | D. Coated,C,"Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text, “spread” most nearly means extended. The text states that the zoo is “huge,” that it covers “numberless acres,” and that it is large enough that a train is needed to explore it. Thus, the text’s emphasis on the zoo’s size suggests that the zoo extended, or stretched, over a large area of land. Choice A is incorrect because if the zoo covers “numberless acres,” then it could not reasonably be described as hidden, or concealed from view. Choice B is incorrect because there is nothing in the text to suggest that the zoo was discussed, or talked about. Rather, the text focuses on the zoo’s large size. Choice D is incorrect. Although in some contexts “spread” can mean coated, it doesn’t have that meaning in this context because to coat something means to apply a thin layer of a liquid substance, such as oil or paint, to a surface. Therefore, it would not be accurate to say that the zoo coated the acres on which it sits."

In this context, “healthy” would mean not distressed or diseased. The text states that insect damage may cause viburnum plants to be discolored and have abnormal growths. In the next sentence, the phrase “on the other hand” indicates a contrast with the description of plants suffering from damage. Thus, the context contrasts the appearance of healthy, undamaged plants with the appearance of damaged plants. Choice A is incorrect because in this context, “struggling” would mean working against difficulties. The text first describes viburnum plants experiencing damage by insects, and the phrase “on the other hand” then establishes a contrast with that description. It wouldn’t make sense to contrast struggling viburnum plants with those being damaged by insects, because in both cases the plants would be experiencing difficulties. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, “beneficial” would mean producing good or helpful effects. The text doesn’t discuss how viburnum plants affect other things or suggest that the plants are helpful in some way; rather, it focuses on how viburnum plants are affected by certain conditions.

It was likely produced by workers embroidering in sections and then joining the resulting panels together. It’s plausible that the workshop that produced the tapestry had never produced one so large, and some researchers claim that a close examination of the joins—the places where the panels are stitched together—suggests that the workers developed and refined their joining process over the course of production.

It compares the Bayeux Tapestry with other tapestries from eleventh-century France. | D. It describes how researchers determined where the Bayeux Tapestry was produced.,B,"Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole. The text discusses the Bayeux Tapestry, making the point that the workers who produced the huge tapestry in the eleventh century might not have ever produced a tapestry so large before. The text goes on to suggest that because of this lack of previous experience, the workers developed and refined the process of joining the tapestry’s panels over time as they worked. The last sentence of the text then provides an example of an observation that suggests the workers’ process changed: clear misalignment of the borders of the two panels the workers joined first and virtually invisible joins completed later. Thus, the underlined sentence serves to support an argument about the workers who produced the tapestry. Choice A is incorrect because the example given in the last sentence of the text has to do with how the panels of the Bayeux Tapestry were joined by the workers, not with what is depicted in those panels; the text never identifies any people or places depicted in the tapestry. Choice C is incorrect because the last sentence compares how early panels in the Bayeux Tapestry were joined with how later panels in the same tapestry were joined; it doesn’t make any comparison between the Bayeux Tapestry and other tapestries from the same time in France. Choice D is incorrect because the last sentence doesn’t address the location where the Bayeux Tapestry was created; the first sentence of the text presents it as a given that the tapestry was created in France, but nothing in the text indicates how that origin was determined."

In this context, “reflect” means show or make apparent. The text states that because the surface of the Moon was softer when the Moon was still forming than it is now, early asteroid and meteoroid impacts “would have left less of an impression” and, as a result, evidence of them may no longer exist. This context supports the idea that the surface of the Moon may not accurately show signs of early impact events. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that the surface of the Moon may not accurately “receive,” or acquire or experience, early impacts from asteroids or meteoroids. The text indicates that the impacts have already occurred, and it isn’t clear how the Moon’s surface could be accurate or inaccurate in experiencing them. Choice C is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that the surface of the Moon may not accurately “evaluate,” or determine the significance or condition of, early impacts from asteroids or meteoroids, since that would suggest that it’s possible for the Moon’s surface to make a decision of any kind. Choice D is incorrect. In this context, “mimic” would mean to deliberately simulate or closely imitate something.

The text explains that Mr. Brooke has a “too rambling habit of mind,” which the text likens to a disease, saying he is thought to have contracted it. To contract a disease means to acquire or develop a disease. In other words, the text indicates that Mr. Brooke is believed to have acquired, or developed, the habit of mind described in the text. Choice A is incorrect. Although “contracted” can mean limited or restricted in some contexts, here Mr. Brooke is said to draw unpredictable conclusions, suggesting that he exhibits this “too rambling habit of mind,” not that it has been somehow limited or restricted.

In this context, ""an exhaustive"" account would be a thorough one. The text states that much of the evidence from her reign was purposely destroyed—in other words, there is a lack of surviving records. This context conveys that unless there are major new archaeological discoveries, an exhaustive account of Hatshepsut’s reign is unlikely. Choice A is incorrect because in this context, ""an imaginative"" account would be an account based on imagination, or ideas and speculation, rather than facts. The text indicates that much of the evidence of Hatshepsut’s reign was deliberately destroyed, and a lack of evidence actually makes it more likely that accounts will be imaginative to some degree and not strictly factual. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, ""a superficial"" account would be one that is lacking in depth or concerned only with what is obvious. The text indicates that most evidence of Hatshepsut’s reign was purposely destroyed, which suggests that accounts of that time are likely already somewhat superficial, since there is little information available to support deeper knowledge. Further, it would be illogical to suggest that discovering major new evidence would make it more likely that accounts would be superficial. Choice D is incorrect because ""a questionable"" account would be one likely to be challenged or doubted, and since the text suggests that little evidence of Hatshepsut’s reign has survived, accounts of that time probably involve some speculation and thus may already be open to doubt. Further, it would be illogical to suggest that discovering major new evidence would make it more likely that accounts would be questionable."

The author of Text 2 acknowledges that nanohybrids may be more toxic than their constituent parts, but also provides an example of a nanohybrid that has reduced toxicity compared to its components: silicon dioxide and zinc oxide together have all the benefits of zinc oxide nanoparticles without any of the DNA harm zinc oxide has on its own. Choice A is incorrect. While the author of Text 2 gives an example of a nanohybrid that isn’t as toxic as its constituent parts, they don’t argue that the benefit outweighs the risk. They merely argue that “the effects of nanomaterial conjugation vary by case.” Choice B is incorrect. The author of Text 2 states that the effects of nanomaterial conjugation “vary by case,” and that the attention that their potential toxicity has drawn is warranted. If the situation in Text 1 weren’t representative, then there would be less attention to the potential danger of these materials. Furthermore, neither passage suggests that researchers had expected that they could predict the effects of nanomaterial conjugation. Choice C is incorrect.

To illustrate the increasing intensity of the speaker’s desire to escape ongoing hardship by gliding on the ocean | B. To contrast the demands of the speaker’s everyday life with the serenity of being rocked to sleep by the ocean | C. To convey the speaker’s longing for the ocean to impart a sense of inner tranquility | D. To justify the speaker’s qualms about being transported by the ocean to a quiet destination,C,"Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately states the main purpose of the text, which is to convey the speaker’s longing for the ocean to impart a sense of inner tranquility, or peace. The text begins by expressing the speaker’s strong desire to be on the ocean, appealing directly to the waves to rock the speaker to sleep. The poem then describes the ""slumberous lullaby"" formed by the sound of the waves and the winds on which the speaker wishes to be carried ""gently...between a peaceful sea and sky."" All these details serve to emphasize the speaker’s desire for the ocean to give them a sense of inner tranquility. Choice A is incorrect. Given the poem’s expression of a longing to achieve tranquility by drifting on the ocean, it can be inferred that the speaker desires to escape something unpleasant in daily life. However, the poem doesn’t refer directly to any such hardship—ongoing or otherwise. And since the poem doesn’t establish that the speaker is experiencing a desire to escape ongoing hardship, it can’t be said that such a desire increases in intensity. Choice B is incorrect. The speaker does express a desire for the serenity of being rocked to sleep by the ocean, and it can be inferred that this desire is a response to demands that make the speaker’s daily life stressful. However, the poem doesn’t refer directly to such demands or contrast them with the tranquility of drifting on the ocean.

To convey a contrast between Jane’s outward calmness and internal restlessness | B. To emphasize Jane’s loyalty to the people she works for at Thornfield Hall | C. To demonstrate that Jane finds her situation both challenging and deeply fulfilling | D. To describe Jane’s determination to secure employment outside of Thornfield Hall,A,"Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text, which is to show that while Jane calmly goes about her daily tasks, she is experiencing internal agitation about possibly seeking a new job. At the start of the text, Jane says, “I went on with my day’s business tranquilly,” indicating that she is outwardly calm. This outward calmness is then contrasted with her intense internal restlessness, as Jane says that thoughts of leaving her job keep running through her mind, that she is “involuntarily framing advertisements” (meaning that she can’t stop herself from thinking up potential listings for jobs), and that she often wonders what new “situations” (or jobs) would be like. Choice B is incorrect because the text gives no indication of Jane’s feelings, either positive or negative, about the people she works for at Thornfield Hall. And rather than emphasizing that Jane feels particularly loyal to her employers, the text focuses on her constant consideration of leaving her job. Choice C is incorrect because the text gives no indication that Jane finds her current situation fulfilling, or satisfying. Given that much of the text is focused on Jane’s thoughts about possibly leaving her job for a new one, it might be the case that she finds her situation challenging, but there is no evidence in the text that Jane also finds that situation satisfying—she says nothing positive about her current job at all, in fact. Choice D is incorrect because the text describes Jane as wondering about getting a new job, not as determined to definitely do so. Jane keeps thinking about reasons why she “should” quit her current job (indicating that she hasn’t yet decided to) and imagining possible new situations she could find, but she says at the end of the text that these thoughts “might germinate and bear fruit if they could,” meaning that the thoughts haven’t yet led to a decision—that Jane isn’t yet determined to get a new job somewhere else."

As used in this context, “newfound” means recently discovered or established. The text indicates that in the 1970s, video cameras became cheaper and therefore more widely available than they had been in the past. The text goes on to say that this development provided Jenkins and other artists with capabilities that they previously didn’t have. As a result, Jenkins began producing groundbreaking works of video art. This context supports the idea that Jenkins took advantage of newfound access to video cameras. Choice B is incorrect because “delicate” means fine in texture or structure or easily broken, neither of which would make sense in this context. The text doesn’t focus on describing what video art looks like or whether it’s breakable. Choice C is incorrect because “inevitable” means impossible to avoid, which wouldn’t make sense in this context. The text doesn’t discuss the likelihood of artists, or anyone else, gaining access to video cameras. Choice D is incorrect because “habitual” means doing something regularly or repeatedly. Although the text does suggest that Jenkins created multiple pieces of video art, its focus is on the fact that video cameras had only just become widely available to artists in the 1970s. Jenkins’s ability to take advantage of video cameras to make art was therefore newfound, not habitual, at the time."

The text establishes that many countries have adopted risk-disclosure requirements for financial products due to concerns that consumers don’t understand the risks associated with the products. According to the text, Seira et al. found that the effects of such messaging on consumer behavior were small and temporary. The text then adds that the researchers assert that because the cost of the messaging is negligible, the approach may be worth doing even if the effects are limited. Thus, the underlined portion notes a factor—very low cost—that led the researchers to not completely dismiss risk-disclosure messaging despite their evidence of its limited utility. Choice B is incorrect because the underlined portion doesn’t refer to a particular type of risk-disclosure messaging, whether Seira et al. considered it or not; the underlined portion simply indicates that the cost of the messaging (broadly) is very low, which makes the approach worth pursuing even if its effects are limited. Choice C is incorrect. Although the underlined portion does describe a consideration that led the researchers to recommend risk-disclosure messaging despite the messaging’s small effects on consumer behavior, it directly states that the cost of such messaging is negligible, or very low—meaning that both the effects and the costs are small, not that the effects are small only relative to the costs. Choice D is incorrect because there’s no indication that Seira et al. suggest that risk-disclosure messaging could be more effective if it had lower costs; rather, the underlined portion indicates that Seira et al. believe the already negligible cost of messaging makes the approach worth pursuing even if its effects are limited."

A change in Earth’s orbit that affected climate has been posited as a cause of desertification, but archaeologist David Wright also attributes the shift to Neolithic peoples. He cites their adoption of pastoralism as a factor in the region drying out: the pastoralists’ livestock depleted vegetation, prompting the events that created the Sahara Desert. Text 2 Research by Chris Brierley et al. challenges the idea that Neolithic peoples contributed to the Sahara’s desertification. Using a climate-vegetation model, the team concluded that the end of the region’s humid period occurred 500 years earlier than previously assumed. The timing suggests that Neolithic peoples didn’t exacerbate aridity in the region but, in fact, may have helped delay environmental changes with practices (e.g., selective grazing) that preserved vegetation.","Based on the texts, how would Chris Brierley (Text 2) most likely respond to the discussion in Text 1?","A.

By insisting that pastoralism can have both beneficial and deleterious effects on a region’s vegetation and climate | D. By asserting that more research needs to be conducted into factors that likely contributed to the desertification of the Sahara region",A,"Choice A is the best answer. Brierley et al.’s research directly challenges Wright’s claim that pastoralism turned the Sahara into a desert, suggesting that, in a Sahara that turned arid 500 years earlier than previously thought, pastoral practices may have actually “preserved vegetation” rather than depleting it. Choice B is incorrect. Brierley et al.’s research actually disputes the idea that any Neolithic peoples’ behaviors, including pastoralism, could have contributed to the Sahara’s changing climate. In fact, their research implies that the Neolithic peoples’ practices did not “exacerbate aridity” (i.e., make things worse), but may have slowed environmental changes. Choice C is incorrect. Brierley et al.’s research does not acknowledge that pastoralism can have deleterious (i.e., negative) effects on a region’s vegetation and climate. It only describes one possible beneficial effect: preserving vegetation through practices like selective grazing. Choice D is incorrect.

The text describes a study in which cuttlefish demonstrated an ability to exercise restraint by waiting for a favorite treat instead of eating a meal that was already available to them. That is, by delaying gratification, the cuttlefish in the study demonstrated that they were capable of, or competent at, exercising self-control. Choice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that in demonstrating self-control, cuttlefish are ""awkward,"" or lacking skill or grace. If anything, the text indicates that cuttlefish appear to be surprisingly skilled at exercising self-control.

In this context, ""mediated by"" means influenced or affected by something. The text establishes that increasing household spending power (an economic factor) produced ""mixed effects"" on mobility decisions. The text then explains that residential choices are ""not fully reducible to economic factors,"" which means that these decisions don’t simply rely on how much money is available to spend on a residential move but on other factors as well. According to the text, noneconomic considerations, such as access to social networks, also play a significant role. Thus, ""mediated by"" accurately captures this relationship where noneconomic factors influence what might otherwise be purely economic decisions.

Text 2 A 2022 experiment by Manon Jünger et al. led to a greater understanding of soy sauce’s flavor profile. The team initially presented a mixture of compounds with low molecular weights to taste testers who found it was not as salty or bitter as real soy sauce.

Ishii and O’Mahony were trying to isolate the pure umami flavor, while Jünger was trying to recreate soy sauce, which has a mix of flavors that includes umami. Accordingly, the broths from Text 1 are not described as having any soy sauce in them—just “shiitake mushrooms and kombu seaweed.” So they probably don’t have as much of the dipeptides described in Text 2, which were found to be a key part of soy sauce’s umami-ness and its saltiness. Choice A is incorrect. Neither text supports this. Neither text gets into the diets of people in the United States, nor the diets of people in Japan. Choice B is incorrect. Neither text supports this.

The text indicates that The Books of Jacob has a large cast of characters, a complicated and wandering plot (that is, a plot that is difficult to follow), and reverse page numbering. Together, these features make up a novel that’s challenging to read and summarize. This context supports the idea that a brief book review can’t do justice to the novel’s complexity. Choice A is incorrect. Although the word “accuracy,” or being free from error or falsehood, can sometimes be used to describe a novel, the text doesn’t discuss whether Tokarczuk’s novel has this quality. Instead, the text describes the novel as having a large cast of characters, a difficult-to-follow plot, and reverse page numbering. These features suggest complexity, not accuracy. Choice B is incorrect because “inactivity” means being in a state of idleness or doing nothing, neither of which would make sense in this context. The text describes Tokarczuk’s novel, and although it’s possible the novel could portray its characters as inactive, it wouldn’t make sense to describe the novel itself as such.

The text tells a story of a first impression that turned out to be wrong: a serious American savant was dismissive of a goofy-looking, wisecracking guest at a British party, and then was shocked to learn that the guest was actually a prominent British chemist and inventor. Choice A is incorrect. This is too strong and too narrow. Only at the very end is the savant ""thrown aback"" by the fact that the man was Sir Humphry Davy—he’s not ""embarrassed about his own behavior."" Choice C is incorrect. This isn’t the main purpose. The text never provides the history of how Sir Humphry Davy came to be famous. Nor does it provide any history for the American savant. Choice D is incorrect. This is too narrow.

Ailey often incorporated improvisation, a signature characteristic of jazz music, in his work. When managing his dance company, Ailey rarely forced his dancers to an exact set of specific moves.

They thrive even in very harsh conditions. That’s why Noah Fierer and colleagues were surprised when soil samples they collected from an extremely cold, dry area in Antarctica didn’t seem to contain any life. The finding doesn’t prove that there are no microbes in that area, but the team says it does suggest that the environment severely restricts microbes’ survival. Text 2 Microbes are found in virtually every environment on Earth. So it’s unlikely they would be completely absent from Fierer’s team’s study site, no matter how extreme the environment is. There were probably so few organisms in the samples that current technology couldn’t detect them. But since a spoonful of typical soil elsewhere might contain billions of microbes, the presence of so few in the Antarctic soil samples would show how challenging the conditions are.","Based on the texts, Fierer’s team and the author of Text 2 would most likely agree with which statement about microbes?",A. Most microbes are better able to survive in environments with extremely dry conditions than in environments with harsh temperatures. | B. A much higher number of microbes would probably be found if another sample of soil were taken from the Antarctic study site. | C. Microbes are likely difficult to detect in the soil at the Antarctic study site because they tend to be smaller than microbes found in typical soil elsewhere. | D. Most microbes are probably unable to withstand the soil conditions at the Antarctic study site.,D,"Choice D is the best answer because it presents a statement about microbes with which Fierer’s team (Text 1) and the author of Text 2 would most likely agree. Text 1 states that microbes usually thrive in very harsh conditions, and so Fierer’s team was surprised when samples collected from an extremely cold and dry area of Antarctica didn’t appear to contain any life. Fierer’s team says that though this doesn’t conclusively prove there are no microbes in the area, it suggests that microbes would have a notably difficult time surviving in the environment. The author of Text 2 says it’s unlikely that there would be no microbes at all in the Antarctic study site from which Fierer’s team retrieved soil samples and that there may have been hard-to-detect microbes in the samples. However, the presence of only a few microbes in the Antarctic samples rather than the billions found in a typical soil sample (which would presumably be much easier to detect) would illustrate conditions in the Antarctic soil that make it difficult for microbes to thrive. Since Fierer’s team says that the seeming absence of microbes in the Antarctic samples suggests an unusually harsh environment and the author of Text 2 says that even if there are a few undetectable microbes in the samples, the relatively tiny number of microbes would also suggest an unusually harsh environment, then Fierer’s team and the author of Text 2 would most likely agree that most microbes are unable to withstand the soil conditions at the Antarctic study site. Choice A is incorrect. The samples taken by Fierer’s team were from an area of Antarctica that is described in part as extremely dry, and these samples didn’t appear to have any life. Therefore, even though these samples also came from an extremely cold area, Fierer’s team wouldn’t argue based on the evidence available that microbes were better able to survive in dry conditions than in areas with harsh temperatures. Moreover, the author of Text 2 says that microbes are found in virtually every environment on Earth but doesn’t compare dry environments and harsh environments. Choice B is incorrect. Nothing in Text 1 indicates that another collection of samples from the Antarctic study site might yield different results from the samples already taken by Fierer’s team. The author of Text 2 does state that microbes are found in virtually every environment on Earth and suggests that new technology may be better able to detect so few microbes in a soil sample, but the author of Text 2 concludes that the unusual absence of microbes in the Antarctic samples is evidence of the harsh Antarctic environment. Therefore, there is no reason to believe that the author of Text 2 thinks that another sample drawn from that same harsh environment would yield a much higher number of microbes. Choice C is incorrect. The author of Text 2 does speculate that there may have been so few microbes in the Antarctic samples that current technology couldn’t detect them, but the author doesn’t speculate that this is due to the size of the microbes. Moreover, nothing that Fierer’s team says suggests that they are speculating that their samples might have microbes that are smaller than microbes in typical soil samples."

The trees in their spring beauty sent through her restive mind a sharp thrill of pleasure. Seductive, charming, and beckoning as cities were, they had not this easy unhuman loveliness.","As used in the text, what does the word “beckoning” most nearly mean?",A. Demanding | B. Signaling | C. Inviting | D. Shifting,C,"Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text, “beckoning” most nearly means “inviting,” or attractive. The text portrays a woman who is looking at “trees in their spring beauty.” She compares them to cities, which have their own pleasures even if they do not have the “easy unhuman loveliness” of trees: she thinks of cities as “seductive” and “charming,” both adjectives that signify something that is enticing, or attractive. Therefore, cities that are seductive and charming would also be described as inviting people closer to them. Choice A is incorrect because there is no indication in this context that cities are “demanding,” or requiring effort. Choice B is incorrect. Though “signaling,” or communicating something, might be considered a key feature of the act of “beckoning,” in the context here, “beckoning” suggests that cities have attractive qualities that naturally draw people to them. Such attractive qualities are not described by the word “signaling” alone. Therefore, “signaling” is an incorrect answer because it is insufficiently precise. Choice D is incorrect because there is no reason to think in this context that the cities are “shifting,” or changing shape."

Some historians have even used these objects to identify potential skin diseases that may have afflicted people at the time. Text 2 Art historian and archaeologist Lisa Trever has argued that the interpretation of Moche “portrait” vessels as hyper-realistic portrayals of identifiable people may inadvertently disregard the creativity of the objects’ creators. Moche ceramic vessels, Trever argues, are artworks in which sculptors could free their imagination, using realistic objects and people around them as inspiration to explore more abstract concepts.","Based on the texts, what would Lisa Trever (Text 2) most likely say about the interpretation presented in the underlined portion of Text 1?",A. Depictions of human faces are significantly more realistic than depictions of plants and other animals are. | B. It is likely that some depictions of human faces with extensive markings are intended to portray the same historical individual. | C. Some vessels may have been damaged during their excavation and thus provide little insight into Moche culture. | D. Markings on depictions of human faces are not necessarily intended to portray particular details about the physical appearance of individuals.,D,"Choice D is the best answer. Trever thinks that the “hyper-realistic portrayal of identifiable people” interpretation ignores the sculptors’ imagination and creativity. We can infer that Trevor thinks the facial markings on the sculptures may not have represented real skin blemishes on real people. Choice A is incorrect.

Neither text compares the depictions of human faces to the depictions of plants or animals, so we have no basis to draw this conclusion. Choice B is incorrect. The text gives us no reason to think that Trever would respond to the underlined interpretation in this way. There’s nothing in either text about multiple depictions representing the same person, so we have no basis to draw this conclusion. Choice C is incorrect.

In this context, ""arduous"" means that the process is marked by great labor or effort. According to the text, the creation of the 1926 animated film The Adventures of Prince Achmed took three years and was a painstaking process. Since the process was so long and required great efforts by Lotte Reiniger and her team, the creation of the film was therefore an arduous process. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t indicate that the creation of Reiniger’s film was ""a haphazard,"" or disorganized, process. In fact, the text suggests that the creation process was quite meticulous and the team worked hard together to produce the envisioned effects. Choice B is incorrect. While the text does suggest that the creation of Reiniger’s film was a long and difficult process, it doesn’t suggest that the process was ""a contentious"" one, or one causing controversy or argument.

It presents evidence that calls into question the previous sentence’s characterization of Johnson’s artistic development.",A,"Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole. The first sentence of the text indicates that Johnson returned to the US in 1938 at which time his painting style suddenly changed. The second sentence is underlined and gives more detail about this stylistic change, noting that his earlier work consisted largely of landscapes in an expressionist style and his new works were highly stylized portraits of Black Americans. In other words, the function of the underlined sentence is to elaborate on a transitional moment in Johnson’s painting career. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text does mention that Johnson spent a decade in Europe, it does not discuss what other travel Johnson might have done. Furthermore, although the text mentions African, American, and Scandinavian artistic elements in Johnson’s work, it does not indicate that he traveled to different locations to learn about these practices. Choice C is incorrect because the text does not focus on Johnson’s personal life nor does it address how successful his career was in general.

It shows why Israel would not have been able to undertake the enormous amount of labor necessary to run a farm even if he had owned the necessary property. | D. It explains why, when the situation requires it, Israel is able to undertake courageous acts that others would generally avoid.",B,"Choice B is the best answer because it best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole. The text describes the failed attempt of Israel Potter to establish a farm in New England during the late eighteenth century: according to his contract, he was to receive two hundred acres in exchange for three months’ work, but his employer then refused to fulfill the bargain and Israel had no recourse to law to obtain the land he was owed. Israel was therefore forced to find another means of supporting himself. To explain why Israel was particularly susceptible to his employer’s dishonesty, the underlined portion states that though Israel was ""brave-hearted, and even much of a dare-devil upon a pinch,"" he also possessed ""a singular patience and mildness."" In other words, Israel could be courageous in certain circumstances, but he was usually meek and disinclined to argument, from which it is reasonable to infer that Israel was often taken advantage of. Thus, the underlined portion suggests that if not for a certain aspect of his character, Israel might not have been as easily thwarted in his ambition to establish a farm. Choice A is incorrect because although the underlined portion describes aspects of Israel’s personality, it does not address how he feels about his own personality. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined portion addresses Israel’s occasional courage and frequent meekness but does not address whether he would have the skills and resolve necessary to operate a farm if he owned sufficient property. Choice D is incorrect. Though the underlined portion does indicate that Israel could be courageous in certain circumstances, it does not say that he undertook acts of courage that others avoided, but rather that he was habitually meek. Even if the underlined portion did say that Israel was more courageous than most, this would not explain why he found himself under the circumstances described in the text—that is, as a consequence of his meek nature, cheated of the property to which he had a right."

In this context, “widespread” means widely accepted or practiced. The text indicates that because Sequoyah’s script accurately represented the spoken sounds of the Cherokee language and was easy to learn, nearly all Cherokee people were able to read and write it soon after it was created. This context demonstrates that the script was widely used by the Cherokee people. Choice B is incorrect. In this context, “careful” would mean exercised with care and attentive concern. Although the work of creating a writing system likely involved great care, the text indicates that the system was “easy to learn,” which conflicts with the idea that using this system requires a noteworthy amount of care. Choice C is incorrect because in this context “unintended” means not deliberate. The idea that using Sequoyah’s script was unintentional conflicts directly with the claim that it was easy to learn and used by “over 90% of the Cherokee people” by 1830. In fact, because one had to learn this system, it’s not clear how one could use it unintentionally.

The text begins by stating that companies are increasingly giving consumers opportunities to customize products, allowing them to make design choices when buying certain sneakers, jewelry, and clothing. The text then indicates that although this trend benefits companies because they can successfully charge buyers more for customized products and don’t have to rush production, it also poses a challenge because producing unique items may require different and more expensive methods than the ones typically used for mass production, raising the companies’ costs. Thus, the text first introduces a trend in consumer products and then explains how the trend both benefits and poses a challenge to companies. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t present the customization of various products as a recent innovation—the fact that there are ""more opportunities"" now indicates that there were opportunities before—and no other innovations, in product manufacturing or otherwise, are discussed. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t discuss any particular company or example and instead speaks broadly about the trend of companies providing customizable products.

Even more rare were self-portrait paintings that portrayed the artist as a painter. At the time, painting was not yet respected as a profession, so painters mostly chose to emphasize other qualities in their self-portraits, like their intellect or social status. In the city of Bologna, the first artist to depict themself painting was a man named Annibale Carracci. A painting of his from around 1585 shows Carracci in front of an easel holding a palette. Text 2 In their self-portraits, Bolognese artists typically avoided referring to the act of painting until the mid-1600s. However, Lavinia Fontana’s 1577 painting, Self-Portrait at the Keyboard , stands out as the earliest example of such a work by an artist from Bologna.

Carracci and Fontana were among the most well-respected painters in Bologna at the time. | B. The depiction of Fontana in Self-Portrait at the Keyboard was intended to underscore the artist’s creativity. | C. Fontana likely inspired the reference to an easel and palette in Carracci’s painting. | D. Self-Portrait at the Keyboard was painted earlier than Carracci’s painting and also refers to the artist’s craft.,D,"Choice D is the best answer. The author of Text 2 states that Fontana’s painting, which depicts a painting easel in the background, was made in 1577, eight years before Carracci’s painting. Therefore, they might argue that Caracci was not “the first artist” to depict themself as a painter. Choice A is incorrect. The texts don’t support this choice. Neither text mentions the reputation or status of either Carracci or Fontana. Choice B is incorrect. The author of Text 2 does not comment on the intention or meaning of Fontana’s self-depiction in Self-Portrait at the Keyboard . This choice also holds little connection to the underlined claim. Choice C is incorrect. The texts don’t support this choice. The author of Text 2 does not suggest any inspirational relationship between Fontana and Carracci. The author of Text 2 is concerned with showing that Fontana’s painting is the earliest example of an artist referring to painting in their self-portrait, but makes no mention of her influence on others."

Additionally, flowers that were visited by both moths and bees produced more seeds than flowers that were only visited by bees.",Which choice best states the function of the underlined sentence?,A. To describe an approach a team of scientists used to study pollinators | B. To question a claim scientists make about pollinators | C. To explain why moths prefer red clover to other flowers | D. To announce an unexpected research finding about red clover,A,"Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the function of the underlined sentence. The sentence indicates that scientists used time-lapse photography during both day and night to detect pollinators visiting red clover. Therefore, the underlined sentence has the function of describing an approach scientists used in the pollinator study discussed in the text. Choice B is incorrect because the underlined sentence discusses equipment the scientists used to conduct their study, and the text provides nothing to suggest these elements of their experimental design could, by themselves, question claims resulting from the study. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in either the underlined sentence or the rest of the text addresses whether moths have a preference for red clover or any other flowers. Choice D is incorrect. Although the sentences that follow the underlined sentence discuss research findings, nothing in the text suggests that these findings were unexpected. Moreover, the underlined sentence describes part of the scientists’ experimental design (day and night time-lapse photography), not a finding of the scientists’ study."

In this context, “validate” means to confirm that something is real or correct. According to the text, it was alleged, or claimed, that the newly discovered letters had been written by Lincoln and Rutledge. The text also indicates that historians ultimately decided the letters were a hoax, or fraudulent. This context suggests that the historians couldn’t confirm that the letters were authentic. Choice B is incorrect. The text focuses on the authenticity of the letters, which were claimed to have been written by Lincoln and Rutledge and were then quickly dismissed as fraudulent by historians. Rather than conveying that the historians simply weren’t able to “interpret,” or explain in an understandable way, the letters’ authenticity, the text suggests that the historians decided the letters lacked authenticity altogether. Choice C is incorrect. The text states that the historians quickly dismissed the letters claimed to have been written by Lincoln and Rutledge as fraudulent; this suggests that rather than being unable to “relate,” or tell others about, the letters’ authenticity, the historians were able to share what they’d decided about the letters. Choice D is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to suggest that the historians couldn’t “accommodate,” or give consideration to, the authenticity of the letters claimed to have been written by Lincoln and Rutledge; the text states that the historians decided that the letters were fraudulent, which indicates that they did consider whether the letters were authentic."

It provides an example of an autobiography that describes help given by an Indigenous people to a Black freedom seeker. | B. It shows why Loguen decided to write in great detail about his experiences traveling from Tennessee to Canada in his autobiography. | C. It argues that autobiographies are particularly important sources of information about geography in the United States before the Civil War. | D. It suggests that most historians believe that Neshnabé villagers were more successful in assisting freedom seekers than other people were.,A,"Choice A is the best answer. The previous sentence broadly mentions ""autobiographies written by the freedom seekers."" This sentence identifies Loguen’s autobiography as a specific example. Choice B is incorrect. The sentence never explains why Loguen chose to write about his experiences. Choice C is incorrect. The previous sentence identifies autobiographies as useful sources of historical information about a specific topic, but not for ""information about geography."" The underlined sentence provides details of one autobiography as an example of a source of information about that specific topic (interactions between Indigenous people and Black freedom seekers). Choice D is incorrect. The text never discusses other specific people who helped freedom seekers, and therefore can’t make a comparison between the Neshnabé and anyone else."

Researchers hypothesize that this difference between the two feline species may be partly due to a U-shaped bone in their throats called the hyoid. Sand cats, which are much smaller than lions, have a rigid hyoid that rumbles when the cat’s larynx vibrates, resulting in a purr. By contrast, lions have a somewhat flexible hyoid, and the bone is attached to the skull with a stretchy ligament that sand cats lack. These traits allow lions and most other species of big cats to produce powerful roars.

The text begins by posing a question about two different cat species: ""Why do sand cats purr but lions roar?"" The remainder of the text then presents a possible answer to this question by explaining a hypothesis about differences in these cats’ hyoid bone structure. The text details how sand cats have rigid hyoids that produce purring sounds when their larynx vibrates, while lions have more flexible hyoids attached to the skull with a stretchy ligament that enables roaring but may prevent purring. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t present facts that weaken the theory about two cat species; rather, it asks a question about two species and then discusses a potential answer. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t discuss the habitats of sand cats and lions at all, nor does it mention any changes to their habitats. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t describe a behavior shared by the two cat species mentioned. On the contrary, it specifically focuses on the different vocalization behaviors of each species (purring versus roaring) and why those differences may exist."

As used in this context, “exemplifies” means demonstrates. The text conveys how the Crow Tribe–Montana State University collaboration serves to illustrate the model of community-based participatory research introduced earlier in the text and expanded on later in the text. Choice A is incorrect because referring to “circumvents,” or avoids, wouldn’t make sense in context. The text suggests that the Crow Tribe–Montana State University collaboration serves as an example of the principles of community-based participatory research, not that the collaboration evades this model. Choice B is incorrect because referring to “eclipses,” or overshadows, wouldn’t make sense in context. The text describes the Crow Tribe–Montana State University collaboration as an equal partnership, which indicates that it’s an example of the community-based participatory research model, not that it overshadows the model.

This project has allowed researcher Seiichi Nagihara to make use of the information in investigating temperature changes on the Moon.",Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?,A. predictable | B. complicated | C. representative | D. available,D,"Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of how a data-transfer project affected data from equipment from the Apollo Moon landings. In this context, ""available"" means accessible or able to be used. The text explains that the Apollo equipment is still on the Moon, but the data it collected ""were mostly inaccessible"" until a data-transfer project was undertaken. The text then states that this project allowed a researcher to use the information that has been collected. This context makes it clear that the project made previously inaccessible data available, or accessible. Choice A is incorrect because saying that a project made data from the Apollo equipment on the Moon ""predictable"" would mean that the data could be known or declared in advance, and it’s not clear how that would be achieved, particularly with data that had been ""mostly inaccessible"" before the project. Rather than suggesting that the data-transfer project made the data predictable, the text conveys that it made the data available to be used as sources of information. Choice B is incorrect because the sentence indicates that data from the Apollo equipment on the Moon were ""mostly inaccessible"" until a recent data-transfer project did something to them, after which a researcher was able to make use of the data. This context conveys that the project made the data accessible and usable, not that it made them ""complicated,"" or complex or difficult to understand. Choice C is incorrect. In this context, ""representative"" would mean either standing as a symbol of something or serving as a typical example from a group, and the text gives no indication that data retrieved from the Apollo equipment on the Moon was merely an example or symbolic. Rather, the text focuses on the availability and usefulness of the data, indicating that a data-transfer project enabled a researcher to use data that had previously been ""mostly inaccessible."""

In this context, “inadequate” means not satisfactory. The text indicates that the mechanical plastic-recycling process affects the environment and causes “the loss of material quality.” The text contrasts that with Chazovachii’s chemical plastic-recycling process, which is cleaner and produces a desirable product. The text’s emphasis on the negative aspects of mechanical recycling suggests that it is inadequate in terms of environmental impact and the quality of the material the process yields. Choice A is incorrect because in this context “resilient” would mean able to withstand difficulty and the text does not characterize the plastic-recycling process as having this quality or describe any difficulties that these processes might need to overcome. Choice C is incorrect because in this context “dynamic” would mean constantly changing. Although the text suggests that there have been changes in the field of recycling, as is the case with the advent of Chazovachii’s chemical recycling process, there is nothing to suggest that the mechanical process itself has changed or is prone to change. Choice D is incorrect because in this context “satisfactory” would mean acceptable but not perfect. The text mentions only shortcomings of the mechanical process (environmental effects and lower material quality), so the text more strongly supports a negative view of this process and provides no evidence that it would be considered satisfactory."

As used in this context, ""provide"" means supply or make something that’s needed available. The text indicates that some predators supply prey for their young by either leaving dead prey nearby or by bringing live prey to them. Other predators, the text states, feed their young directly from their own mouths. This context supports the idea that predatory animals have various ways to provide food for their young. Choice A is incorrect because in this context, ""avoid"" would mean keep away from or refrain from, neither of which would make sense in context. Nothing in the text suggests that predators refrain from food for their young. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, ""guess"" would mean speculate or suppose, and it’s unclear what it would mean for predators to speculate food for their young.

These unique ______ blank allow fireflies of the same species to find each other.",Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?,A. quantities | B. decorations | C. patterns | D. agreements,C,"Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the flashes created by fireflies. In this context, “patterns” means distinct and predictable sequences. The text indicates that although the flashes that fireflies produce appear to occur randomly—that is, without any particular sequence or rhythm—each species actually produces its own special series of flashes and pauses. Indeed, these series of flashes are so unique that fireflies can use them to find other members of their species. Therefore, this context supports the idea that fireflies produce flashes in distinct and recognizable patterns. Choice A is incorrect because “quantities” means certain amounts or numbers of something. Although the text discusses how different firefly species produce flashes and pauses in unique sequences that help other members of their species to find them, it doesn’t mention the number of flashes that are used in these sequences. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, “decorations” would mean things that make an object more beautiful. Although it may be reasonable to say that firefly flashes are beautiful, the text focuses on the fact that fireflies use these unique sequences of flashes to find other members of their own species, not that the flashes make fireflies more beautiful. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, “agreements” would refer to deals that individuals have discussed and come to a consensus about. Since fireflies aren’t capable of making such agreements, it wouldn’t make sense to use this word to refer to the signals they send each other with their flashes."

Text 2 Past studies of white dwarf atmospheres have concluded that certain exoplanets had continental crusts. Geologist Keith Putirka and astronomer Siyi Xu argue that those studies unduly emphasize atmospheric traces of lithium and other individual elements as signifiers of the types of rock found on Earth.

Text 1 discusses a study by Mark Holland and colleagues in which they detected traces of lithium and sodium in the atmospheres of four white dwarf stars. The team claims that this supports the idea that exoplanets with continental crusts like Earth’s once orbited these stars. Text 2 introduces Putirka and Xu, who indicate that sodium and lithium are present in several different minerals and that some of those minerals might exist in types of rock that are not found on Earth. Therefore, Putirka and Xu would likely describe the conclusion in Text 1 as questionable because it does not consider that lithium and sodium are also found in rocks that are not like Earth’s continental crust. Choice A is incorrect because the texts do not indicate how widely held any of the viewpoints described are. Choice B is incorrect because neither text discusses how new this area of study is.

As used in this context, “replenishes” means helps increase the population or helps it recover. The text explains that although snapping off a wild plant at the root might seem detrimental to the wild population, it actually helps Hierochloe odorata , increasing both their “number and vigor.” This context conveys the idea that even though it seems counterintuitive, the Indigenous method of harvesting Hierochloe odorata actually replenishes the wild population. Choice A is incorrect. Although a harvesting method could be used to select for certain traits in plants, it’s not clear what it would mean for a harvesting method to select “wild populations” of plants. Choice B is incorrect because as used in this context, “originates” means creates. The text doesn’t address the origin of Hierochloe odorata , but rather how the Indigenous harvesting method affects it.

In this context, “variable” means able to change. The text begins by explaining that güiros are instruments made out of hollowed gourds with ridges cut into their sides and that players scrape the ridges with wooden sticks to produce sounds. The text goes on to say that güiros’ sounds can change depending on gourd thickness, the distance between ridges, and the types of strokes the player uses, thus supporting the idea that the sounds created by these instruments are variable. Choice A is incorrect because “overlooked” means not being seen or noticed, and there is nothing in the text to suggest that the sounds produced by güiros are overlooked or not noticed.

In this context, ""consistent"" means steady or unchanging over time. The text introduces a challenge and then explains that wave power varies, or changes, unpredictably in ways that cause problems for electricity generation. This context conveys that the challenge being described is a lack of consistency. Choice A is incorrect because the text introduces a challenge and then elaborates on it by emphasizing that the unpredictable nature of variations in ocean waves causes problems, which doesn’t indicate that wave power isn’t ""accidental,"" or isn’t happening unintentionally.

A case in point: In a 2014 study, Megan O’Brien and Alaa Ahmed had subjects stand or sit while making risky simulated economic decisions. Standing is more physically unstable and cognitively demanding than sitting; accordingly, O’Brien and Ahmed hypothesized that standing subjects would display more risk aversion during the decision-making tasks than sitting subjects did, since they would want to avoid further feelings of discomfort and complicated risk evaluations. But O’Brien and Ahmed actually found no difference in the groups’ performance.",Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?,"A. It argues that research findings about the effects of posture on cognition are often misunderstood, as in the case of O’Brien and Ahmed’s study. | B. It presents the study by O’Brien and Ahmed to critique the methods and results reported in previous studies of the effects of posture on cognition. | C. It explains a significant problem in the emerging understanding of posture’s effects on cognition and how O’Brien and Ahmed tried to solve that problem. | D. It discusses the study by O’Brien and Ahmed to illustrate why caution is needed when making claims about the effects of posture on cognition.",D,"Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text. The text notes that although some studies have suggested that posture may have an effect on cognition, this phenomenon should not be overstated. In other words, the text begins by urging caution and restraint when discussing the effects of posture on cognition, implying that even though some studies have shown posture to affect cognition, we should not assume that posture always affects cognition or does so in a strong way. The text goes on to discuss O’Brien and Ahmed’s study as a ""case in point"" (that is, as an example of the point made previously). According to the text, O’Brien and Ahmed hypothesized that since standing is more cognitively demanding than sitting, standing subjects in their experiment would respond differently to decision-making tasks than sitting subjects would, which would show an effect of posture on cognition. What the researchers actually found, however, was that the standing and sitting subjects performed the same—posture did not affect cognition. By presenting a circumstance in which posture does not appear to affect cognition, the discussion of O’Brien and Ahmed’s study shows why it is important not to overstate the phenomenon. The purpose of the text, therefore, is to discuss O’Brien and Ahmed’s study to illustrate why caution is needed when making claims about posture’s effects on cognition. Choice A is incorrect because the text discusses O’Brien and Ahmed’s study as an example of why caution is needed when discussing posture’s effects on cognition, not as an example of how research findings related to posture and cognition are often misunderstood. Although the text does warn against misunderstanding the scope of the relationship between posture and cognition that has been reported in some previous studies, O’Brien and Ahmed’s study is not one of those studies, and there is no suggestion that anyone has misunderstood O’Brien and Ahmed’s findings. Choice B is incorrect because the text makes no mention of the methods used in previous studies of the effects of posture on cognition. Although the text does urge caution when discussing posture’s effects on cognition, it does not critique the results of studies that suggested that posture can affect cognition. Instead, the text suggests that such results should not be exaggerated or taken too broadly. Choice C is incorrect because although the text implies that overstating posture’s effects on cognition would be a problem, nothing in the text suggests that O’Brien and Ahmed share that view or that they attempted to solve that problem. O’Brien and Ahmed are presented as hypothesizing that posture would affect cognition in their study, not as trying to resolve the problem the text describes."

Simple | B. Understandable | C. Obvious | D. Transparent,D,"Choice D is the best answer because as used in the text, ""clear"" most nearly means transparent, or see-through. Muir states that the water beneath the boat ""was so clear that it was almost invisible,"" suggesting that those on the boat were able to see through the water and easily observe plants and fish below the surface. Choice A is incorrect. In some contexts ""clear"" can mean ""simple,"" or uncomplicated, but Muir is describing the water, and water isn’t typically described as either simple or complicated. Muir emphasizes the water’s transparency, not its simplicity. Choice B is incorrect. In some contexts ""clear"" can mean ""understandable,"" or reasonable or easily comprehended, but Muir is describing the water, and it doesn’t make much sense to describe water as understandable. Muir emphasizes the water’s transparency, not how easily the water can be understood. Choice C is incorrect. Although ""clear"" can mean ""obvious,"" or easily seen or understood, in some contexts, Muir’s description emphasizes that the water ""was almost invisible"" and that the boat seemed to be ""sustained in the air,"" suggesting that the water was almost impossible to see, not that it was obvious."

It introduces a trait shared by certain animals in order to contextualize a hypothesis about the origin of that trait that is advanced later in the text.,A,"Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined statement functions in the text as a whole. The underlined statement mentions a category of animals that have a feature in common: they tend to have fixed geographic ranges throughout their lifetimes. The text then presents the speculation of some researchers that the Arctic woolly mammoth might also share this characteristic. However, an examination of the content of strontium in the strata (or layers) of a woolly mammoth tusk indicated that contrary to the researchers’ hypothesis, the mammoth had an expanding range in its environment that contracted in its last 1.5 years of life. Thus, the underlined statement discusses a characteristic shared by certain animals in order to explain why researchers raised a possibility that turned out not to be supported by data described later in the text. Choice B is incorrect. Though the underlined statement presents a pattern of behavior (the habit of certain animals of staying within a fixed geographic range), the rest of the text does not present a theory of exceptions to that pattern; rather, the researchers are merely concerned with whether one particular animal has behavior consistent with the pattern. Choice C is incorrect. Though the underlined statement does describe a similarity in the behavior of certain animals (their tendency to stay within a fixed geographic range), this is not done in order to show why a method described later in the text failed to show whether another animal showed that behavior; rather, the method of analysis of strata of a woolly mammoth tusk showed that the mammoth’s behavior was different from that of the animals mentioned in the underlined statement.

The text indicates that raising the age for these funds is usually discussed in terms of effects on fund recipients but that Andria Smythe is instead considering the effects on working family members who care for retirees. Smythe notes that raising the age for the funds would increase the length of time retirees are dependent on financial assistance from working family members. This is suggested to have an effect on wealth creation for those workers, and most logically, that effect would be disadvantageous. Thus, ""stymie,"" which means to prevent or greatly hinder, is the most logical choice in context. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, ""compound"" would most nearly mean multiply or greatly enhance. The text indicates that raising the age at which retirees are eligible for government funds will increase the amount of time retirees are dependent on working family members for financial support. This would likely have a negative rather than a positive effect on wealth creation. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, ""disparage"" would most nearly mean criticize or defame. Nothing in the text suggests that raising the age at which retirees are eligible for government funds would defame wealth creation among working adults. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, ""outstrip"" would most nearly mean to exceed, and nothing in the text indicates that the financial support provided to retirees would exceed the amount of wealth these workers can create.

First, the speaker describes observing a “most beautiful” sight: a tree (“black cypress”) standing out from the golden sky behind it, looking like a person’s finger “pointing upwards” and appearing “sensitive” and “exquisite.” Then the speaker wonders about the image’s meaning, asking why the finger is black and why it’s pointing upward. Thus, the text moves from the speaker’s description of a distinctive sight in nature to her pondering about what meaning to attribute to that sight. Choice A is incorrect because the speaker assesses a natural sight—a “black cypress” tree standing “against a gold, gold sky” like a pointed finger—but doesn’t question the accuracy of her own assessment. Although she wonders why the finger, which is really a tree, is black and why it’s pointing, the speaker doesn’t suggest that her belief that the tree resembles a finger is wrong. Choice C is incorrect. Although the speaker describes seeing a “black cypress” tree standing “against a gold, gold sky” like a pointed finger, she wonders about that natural image (asking why the finger, which is really a tree, is black and why it’s pointing) and doesn’t give any indication that any people are present in the scene.

The text describes the vibration and warming that Ward and colleagues used to alleviate itching as “harmless applications” and goes on to contrast these applications with another stimulus that actually offers more relief even though it seems to be stronger and “less benign.” This context conveys the idea that vibration and warming were innocuous stimuli. Choice A is incorrect because the text focuses on a distinction between harmless stimuli and those that seem to be less benign. Nothing in the text suggests that any of the treatments are “deceptive,” or misleading; indeed, even the less effective ones are described as offering some relief.

As used in this context ""intangible"" means unable to be physically handled or touched. The text states that star formations cannot be touched, and then goes on to explain that Imara created a special model to research star formations. In other words, despite the fact that real star formations are intangible, thanks to Imara, researchers can handle models of star formations to better understand them. Choice A is incorrect because ""repeatable"" means can be duplicated or done again, which wouldn’t make sense in context. The text indicates that the swirls of gas and dust in which stars form are untouchable, but that Nia Imara has produced interactive models of them.

As used in this context, “persistent” means existing continuously. The text states that Wauneka “continuously worked to promote public health,” traveling extensively and authoring a medical dictionary; this indicates that Wauneka’s effort was persistent. Choice A is incorrect because describing Wauneka’s effort related to public health as “impartial,” or not partial or biased and treating all things equally, wouldn’t make sense in context.

According to the second law of thermodynamics, at a macroscopic level some processes of heat transfer are irreversible due to the production of entropy—after a transfer we cannot rewind time and place molecules back exactly where they were before, just as we cannot unbreak dropped eggs. But laws of physics at a microscopic or quantum level hold that those processes should be reversible. Text 2 In 2015, physicists Tiago Batalhão et al. performed an experiment in which they confirmed the irreversibility of thermodynamic processes at a quantum level, producing entropy by applying a rapidly oscillating magnetic field to a system of carbon-13 atoms in liquid chloroform. But the experiment “does not pinpoint ... what causes [irreversibility] at the microscopic level,” coauthor Mauro Paternostro said.","Based on the texts, what would the author of Text 1 most likely say about the experiment described in Text 2?","A.

Author 1 describes the puzzle that physicists still can’t solve: at a microscopic level, the “laws of physics” suggest that we should be able to reverse processes that are not reversible at a macroscopic level (and, maybe, turn back time!). The experiment confirmed that those processes are not reversible even on the microscopic level, but it didn’t explain why. This supports Author 1’s point that physicists still don’t fully understand how things work at a microscopic level—maybe the laws need to be revised. Choice A is incorrect. We can’t infer that the author of Text 1 would respond this way to the experiment. Text 2 does name two of the physicists involved in the experiment, but it never suggests that they disagree on anything. Choice C is incorrect. This is the opposite of what the experiment suggests. The experiment confirmed that the macroscopic-level law (“these things can’t be reversed—like time”) was still true on the microscopic level—meaning it supports the current understanding of physics at a macroscopic level.

In this context, to say that Pico portrays his “ambivalence toward” nature would mean that he portrays his mixed feelings about nature. The text explains that Pico “honors the centrality of nature” and also makes it clear that he doesn’t enjoy being in nature. This context suggests that Pico feels ambivalence toward nature. Choice A is incorrect because saying that Pico portrays his “responsiveness to” nature would mean that he portrays himself as quick to react to nature, which isn’t supported by the text. Instead, the text focuses on Pico’s mixed feelings toward nature, describing him as both honoring nature’s role in his tribe’s beliefs and expressing his personal dislike for being in nature. Choice C is incorrect because saying that Pico portrays his “renunciation of” nature would mean that he portrays himself as rejecting nature, which isn’t supported by the text. The text conveys that Pico demonstrates both positive and negative responses toward nature, not that he’s giving it up completely. Choice D is incorrect because saying that Pico portrays his “mastery over” nature would mean that he portrays himself as having control over nature, which isn’t supported by the text.

In this context, ""obtain"" means gain or acquire. According to the text, a team of paleontologists has found fossils that are very well preserved. For this reason, the text suggests, the paleontologists have been able to gain detailed information from the fossils, such as the color patterns of the life forms that left them behind. Choice A is incorrect because ""occupy"" means engage or inhabit, neither of which would make sense in context. It’s unclear what it would mean for detailed information revealed by fossils to be engaged or inhabited.

By definition, literature tells a story or conveys meaning through language only; graphic novels tell stories through illustrations and use language only sparingly, in captions and dialogue. Graphic novels are experienced as series of images and not as language, making them more similar to film than to literature. Text 2 Graphic novels present their stories through both language and images. Without captions and dialogue, readers would be unable to understand what is depicted in the illustrations: the story results from the interaction of text and image. Moreover, Alison Bechdel’s Fun Home and many other graphic novels feature text that is as beautifully written as the prose found in many standard novels. Therefore, graphic novels qualify as literary texts.","Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the overall argument presented in Text 1?",A.

By suggesting that the story lines of certain graphic novels are more difficult to understand than the author of Text 1 claims | D. By agreeing with the author of Text 1 that most graphic novels aren’t as well crafted as most literary works are,A,"Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to the argument presented in Text 1. In arguing that graphic novels shouldn’t be classified as literature and are more comparable to film, Text 1 claims that language plays a relatively limited role in graphic novels: images, not language, are the primary means by which graphic novels tell their stories, and language is used ""only sparingly""—that is, comparatively very little—in the form of captions and dialogue. However, the author of Text 2 asserts that language in graphic novels is as equally vital for conveying meaning as images are, since without captions and dialogue, readers wouldn’t be able to make sense of the narrative. Moreover, the author of Text 2 argues that there are many graphic novels that are ""beautifully written"" and whose use of language is as accomplished as any standard novel. Because Text 1 argues that language is subordinate to images in graphic novels, whereas Text 2 highlights how language is an essential component of a graphic novel’s storytelling, it can reasonably be inferred that the author of Text 2 would say that language plays a more important role in graphic novels than the author of Text 1 recognizes. Choice B is incorrect. Although Text 1 indicates that graphic novels shouldn’t be classified as literature based on their limited use of language, there’s no indication that the author of Text 1 considers this limited use of language as a flaw, just that it doesn’t fit the particular definition of ""literature"" proposed in the text. Even if Text 1 had suggested that their use of language was a common flaw of graphic novels, the author of Text 2 emphasizes how many graphic novels are ""beautifully written,"" and would therefore say that their use of language is exemplary, not that it is flawed. Choice C is incorrect because Text 1 doesn’t claim that the story lines of graphic novels are generally relatively easy to understand; in addition, Text 2 argues that given their dependence on the interaction of image and text, the stories of graphic novels would be incomprehensible if their captions and dialogue were removed, not that the story lines of some graphic novels are more difficult to understand than Text 1 acknowledges. Choice D is incorrect because the author of Text 1 doesn’t imply that graphic novels aren’t well crafted, only that they use language too sparingly to fit the definition of ""literature,"" and that their use of images to convey stories makes them more comparable to film than to literature. Even if the author of Text 1 had implied that most graphic novels aren’t well crafted, Text 2 refers to the fact that many graphic novels are as beautifully written—that is, well crafted—as many standard novels; thus, it wouldn’t be accurate to say that the author of Text 2 would agree with the author of Text 1 that most graphic novels aren’t well crafted."

In this context, “inspecting” means viewing closely in order to examine. The text indicates that as particle physicists, Arce and El-Khadra’s work involves using advanced technology to “closely examine” subatomic particles. In other words, they use technology to inspect small parts of matter that can’t be seen by the naked eye. Choice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Arce and El-Khadra spend time “selecting,” or choosing, subatomic particles for some purpose; the text simply states that the particle physicists use advanced technology to see and study the behavior of those tiny parts of matter. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Arce and El-Khadra spend time “creating” subatomic particles, or bringing them into existence; the text simply states that the particle physicists use advanced technology to see and study the behavior of those tiny parts of matter.

Although in some contexts, ""disputing"" can mean arguing, the narrator doesn’t portray the shoppers and vendors as arguing with the driver of the taxi or, indeed, arguing at all. Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts, ""disputing"" can mean expressing disapproval, the narrator doesn’t suggest that the shoppers and vendors necessarily disapprove of the taxi’s attempt to drive down the street.

They stocked some pools with a diverse mix of zooplankton species and others with a single zooplankton species and allowed the pool communities to develop naturally thereafter.

Studies of the environmental impact of its manufacture generally agree it is lower than that of beef and closer to that of chicken or pork. But the expense of producing mycoprotein restricts its availability to a few countries with postindustrial economies. Knowing that cost reductions would expand access to mycoprotein, biochemists are exploring solutions, such as a cheaper substrate to feed the mycoprotein as it grows. Text 2 Cattle farming is a principal cause of global deforestation, and a study by Florian Humpenöder and his colleagues found that replacing 20% of beef consumption worldwide with consumption of mycoprotein would cut deforestation by half if accomplished over the next thirty years.

By noting that most people would be more likely to use mycoprotein as a substitute for chicken or pork in their diets than as a substitute for beef | D. By pointing out that some countries are responsible for greater deforestation than others and thus, to have any significant effect on the environment, will have to replace more than 20% of their beef consumption with mycoprotein",B,"Choice B is the best answer because it reflects how the author of Text 1 would most likely respond to the study findings described in Text 2. The author of Text 2 discusses a study by Florian Humpenöder and his colleagues that found that deforestation would be reduced by half over the next thirty years if 20% of the beef consumed worldwide were replaced with mycoprotein. The author of Text 1 points out that mycoprotein is not widely available because of its high production cost, but goes on to note that this problem could be addressed by the creation of a cheaper substrate to feed mycoprotein. This suggests that the author of Text 1 would assert that the development of a less expensive mycoprotein substrate would contribute to the reduction in deforestation described in the study findings discussed in Text 2: if reducing the cost of mycoprotein increases people’s access to it, then mycoprotein may be able to replace beef in more people’s diets, thereby reducing the deforestation associated with beef production. Choice A is incorrect because the author of Text 1 indicates that the environmental impact of mycoprotein production is close to that of chicken or pork production, so there is no reason to think that the author would assert that replacing chicken or pork with mycoprotein would be environmentally beneficial: such a replacement would not lessen the total environmental impact of food manufacture. Additionally, the specific issue of agricultural water consumption is never mentioned in Text 1, so there is no evidence indicating what the author of Text 1 would say about that issue. Choice C is incorrect. Although Text 1 does compare the environmental effects of producing mycoprotein to those of producing chicken or pork, nothing in Text 1 suggests that the author believes that people are more likely to replace chicken or pork with mycoprotein than they are to replace beef with mycoprotein. Choice D is incorrect because Text 1 makes no mention of countries’ varying contributions to deforestation, so there is no evidence that the author of Text 1 would respond to the finding described in Text 2 by saying that some countries will have to replace more than 20% of their beef consumption with mycoprotein."

As used in this context, “interpret” would mean decipher the meaning of. The text indicates that Ashbery’s poems have many unusual features, that it’s difficult to tell what exactly the poems’ subject matter is, and that scholars strongly disagree about the poems. This context conveys the idea that it’s difficult to interpret Ashbery’s poems.

It could be true that it was difficult for Ashbery to compose his poems, but the text doesn’t address this; it instead discusses how readers interpret and engage with the poems. Choice D is incorrect because describing Ashbery’s poems as being difficult to “renounce,” or give up or refuse, wouldn’t make sense in context.

Lily had no real intimacy with nature, but she had a passion for the appropriate and could be keenly sensitive to a scene which was the fitting background of her own sensations. The landscape outspread below her seemed an enlargement of her present mood, and she found something of herself in its calmness, its breadth, its long free reaches.

It makes an assertion that the next sentence then expands on. | D. It illustrates an idea that is introduced in the previous sentence.,D,"Choice D is the best answer because it best describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The first sentence of the text establishes that Lily can be “keenly sensitive to” scenes that serve as a “fitting background” for her feelings—that is, she’s very aware of when a setting seems to reflect her mood. The next sentence, which is underlined, then demonstrates this awareness: Lily views the landscape she’s in as a large-scale reflection of her current mood, identifying with elements such as its calmness. Thus, the function of the underlined sentence is to illustrate an idea introduced in the previous sentence. Choice A is incorrect because the underlined sentence describes the scene only in very general terms, referring to its calmness, breadth, and long stretches of land. It’s the next sentence that adds specific details about colors, light, and various trees nearby. Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the underlined sentence suggests that Lily is experiencing an internal conflict. In fact, the sentence indicates that Lily thinks the landscape reflects her own feeling of calmness. Choice C is incorrect because the only assertion in the underlined sentence is that Lily feels that broad aspects of the landscape, such as its calmness, reflect her current mood, and that assertion isn’t expanded on in the next sentence. Instead, the next sentence describes specific details of the scene without connecting them to Lily’s feelings."

Their pink color comes from eating brine shrimp, but brine shrimp aren’t naturally pink either. Animals can’t produce carotenoids, the pigments that provide the pink hue. The algae that brine shrimp feed on, however, can produce these pigments. Thus, the pinker the flamingo, the more shrimp it has eaten. Text 2 Ecologist Juan Amat has found that flamingos apply a kind of makeup to make themselves appear pinker. A gland near their tail contains pigments that come from the food they eat. When the flamingos groom themselves using the pigments, their feathers become pinker. Flamingos may do this to improve their success during mating season, when they would benefit from looking pinker.","Based on the texts, how would the ecologist in Text 2 most likely respond to the author’s conclusion in Text 1?",A. By emphasizing that flamingos’ tail feathers are pinker than their other feathers are | B. By claiming that the coloring of flamingos’ feathers doesn’t change significantly enough for most observers to notice | C. By pointing out that the amount of shrimp eaten isn’t the only thing that influences flamingos’ coloring | D. By arguing that flamingos’ diet doesn’t include much shrimp except during mating season,C,"Choice C is the best answer because it describes how the ecologist in Text 2 would most likely respond to the author’s conclusion in Text 1 based on the information provided. The author of Text 1 states that the pink color of flamingo feathers comes from pigments carried by the brine shrimp flamingos consume. The author of Text 1 concludes that this means that a flamingo that is pinker than another flamingo must have eaten more shrimp. However, according to Text 2, ecologist Juan Amat has found that flamingos can also affect how pink they look through grooming, when they move ingested pigments from a gland near the tail to their feathers. This indicates that not all the pigments available from the shrimp a flamingo has eaten automatically end up coloring the flamingo’s feathers; some may or may not be applied later. Since grooming is also a factor, the ecologist (Amat) in Text 2 would most likely respond to the conclusion in Text 1 that pinker flamingos have eaten more shrimp by pointing out that the amount of shrimp eaten isn’t the only thing that influences flamingos’ coloring. Choice A is incorrect. Although Text 2 states that the ecologist has found that flamingos can move pigments to their feathers from a gland near their tail, there is no indication that their tail feathers are pinker than their other feathers. Moreover, the point that tail feathers are pinker than other feathers wouldn’t logically address the idea that the quantity of shrimp eaten is what determines a flamingo’s coloring. Choice B is incorrect because Text 2 indicates that the ecologist has found that flamingos’ feathers do sometimes look pinker and gives no indication that this change in color is particularly subtle. Moreover, the point that most observers wouldn’t notice a change wouldn’t logically address the idea that the quantity of shrimp eaten is what determines a flamingo’s coloring. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in Text 2 suggests that the ecologist would argue about flamingos’ shrimp consumption. Although Text 2 indicates that the ecologist has found that flamingos may make themselves look pinker during mating season, this is addressed in terms of grooming habits; apart from referring to food as a source of pigments, Text 2 doesn’t discuss the diet of flamingos at all."

Choice B is incorrect. The text does mention that Price’s compositions have been performed and recorded by major orchestras, but it doesn’t argue that more orchestras should do so. Choice C is incorrect. The text does mention the blending of Black spirituals and classical European Romantic musical traditions, but only briefly, as part of a broader overview of Price’s career.

It offers a detail about how female cuckoos carry out the behavior discussed in the text. | D. It explains how other birds react to the female cuckoo behavior discussed in the text.,C,"Choice C is the best answer because it best describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The first two sentences establish that birds of some species don’t raise their own young; instead, they lay their eggs in the nests of birds of other species. The underlined sentence then states that female cuckoo birds engage in this behavior, having been observed specifically laying their eggs in other nests while the other birds are out finding food. According to the text, the cuckoo chicks are then raised by the other birds. Thus, the underlined sentence provides a particular detail about how female cuckoos carry out the behavior of laying eggs for other birds to raise. Choice A is incorrect. Rather than mentioning a physical feature of female cuckoos, the underlined sentence introduces a specific behavior of female cuckoos: laying eggs in the nests of birds of other species when the other birds are away. The only reference to physical features is the last sentence’s general mention of cuckoo chicks looking different from chicks of other species. Choice B is incorrect because the underlined sentence refers to the nests of birds other than cuckoos and doesn’t describe how any nests look, cuckoo or otherwise. Instead, the sentence addresses how female cuckoos use other birds’ nests. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined sentence describes only female cuckoo behavior (laying eggs in the nests of birds of other species when the other birds are away); it’s the last sentence of the text that addresses the other birds’ reaction, indicating that those birds usually raise the cuckoo chicks once they’ve hatched."

It explains a hypothesis that has been the subject of scientific debate, discusses how a research team tested that hypothesis, and then presents data the team collected that validate the hypothesis.",B,"Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes the overall structure of the text. The text begins by explaining that human activities influence carbon and nitrogen levels in soil, but how deeply these effects are seen in the soil remains an unresolved question. Next, the text summarizes Okolo and colleagues’ hypothesis regarding this question—which is that the different effects on carbon and nitrogen levels associated with different types of land use would also be observed below the topsoil layer—and then briefly explains the methods they used to test this hypothesis. Finally, the text states that the researchers found that at depths below the topsoil layer, carbon and nitrogen decreased to similarly low levels across all land-use types, a finding that conflicts with the team’s hypothesis presented earlier in the text. Thus, the text introduces an unresolved scientific question, presents a research team’s hypothesis pertaining to that question, and then describes an observation that the team made that conflicted with their hypothesis. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text introduces a phenomenon (the fact that human activities influence carbon and nitrogen levels in the soil) that isn’t fully understood by scientists and explains a research team’s hypothesis about the phenomenon, the text doesn’t describe how the team refined their hypothesis when a research finding contradicted it. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t discuss a process at all; rather, it poses an unsolved scientific question and presents a hypothesis that Okolo and colleagues tested to answer that question. Moreover, the text only describes one hypothesis; it doesn’t mention any competing hypotheses, nor does it suggest that Okolo’s team was able to determine which hypothesis was correct. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t begin by presenting a hypothesis that is under scientific debate; rather, it presents a question that scientists have been unable to answer and then introduces a hypothesis formulated by Okolo and colleagues. While the text does explain how Okolo’s team tested their hypothesis, the text goes on to say that their data conflicted with their hypothesis, not that the data validated, or supported, their hypothesis."

In this context, “commonalities with” means similarities to or shared attributes with. The text indicates that a recently discovered citadel in Tikal includes a close imitation of a famous temple in Teotihuacán (another Mesoamerican city) and other evidence of Teotihuacán influence, which suggests that the citadel possesses features that resemble architectural features found in Teotihuacán. This context thus indicates that the Tikal citadel shows commonalities with Teotihuacán architecture. Choice A is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text that suggests that the Tikal citadel shows “refinements of,” or improvements on, Teotihuacán architecture. Although the text suggests that the architecture of Teotihuacán influenced the architecture of the Tikal citadel, and although it’s possible that later architectural designs could make improvements on earlier designs, the text doesn’t discuss whether, in imitating Teotihuacán architecture, the Tikal citadel’s builders improved on it. Choice B is incorrect because describing the citadel in Tikal as showing “precursors of” Teotihuacán architecture—or features that preceded and foreshadowed those of Teotihuacán architecture—would imply the opposite of what the text suggests about the relationship between the architecture found in Tikal and Teotihuacán. The text claims that the discovery of similarities between the Tikal citadel and the architecture of Teotihuacán, including a replica of a temple in Teotihuacán, provides evidence of outside influences on Tikal architecture. If the Tikal citadel was influenced by Teotihuacán architecture, then the Teotihuacán architecture must predate the citadel, not the other way around. In this context, therefore, it wouldn’t make sense to say that the Tikal citadel shows precursors of Teotihuacán architecture. Choice D is incorrect because the text discusses how the citadel in Tikal indicates the influence of Teotihuacán architecture, which implies that the makers of the Tikal citadel likely admired aspects of Teotihuacán architecture enough to imitate it. Thus, there’s no reason to think that the Tikal citadel provides evidence of the Tikal people’s “animosities toward,” or feelings of strong dislike or hostility toward, Teotihuacán architecture."

Protective | B. Restrictive | C. Affectionate | D. Suspicious,A,"Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, ""sheltering"" most nearly means protective. In the text, the speaker describes a painting featuring a female figure. The speaker ultimately confesses to falling in love with the woman in the painting, who has ""stole[n] away"" the speaker’s heart, but first the speaker describes elements of the painting’s setting. These include sterile soil, barren fields with ""no ray / Of hope in a blade of green""—a description that conveys a mood of melancholy and forlornness, possibly reflecting the speaker’s own sadness at falling in love with an image that can’t return the speaker’s love. The text continues by stating that there’s no ""sheltering roof"" in the painting, even though the ""skies are heavy and gray,"" showing signs of an impending storm. Generally, a roof’s intended purpose is to provide protection from the elements, and in this context, a roof would offer shelter and protection from the gathering storm. Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that a roof would be restrictive—that is, that it would limit or restrain something in some way. Although a roof would provide some cover from stormy winds and rain, it wouldn’t limit the wind and rain, only deflect them. Choice C is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that if a ""sheltering roof"" were present in the painting, it would be affectionate, or loving and tender. In the text, the immediate context in which the word ""sheltering"" appears refers to the absence of a roof that would provide protection from the oncoming storm depicted in the painting, not to the idea that such a shelter would be loving and tender if it were present. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, suspicious would mean questionable or dubious, and there’s nothing in the text to suggest that if any roofs were present in the painting, they would be questionable or cause any suspicion."

Denying | B. Entering | C. Carrying | D. Hearing,D,"Choice D is the best answer because as used in the text, “receiving” most nearly means hearing, or perceiving sound. The text describes Mr. Spring Fragrance as he reads a newspaper, focusing on his eyes and ears. While his eyes look at the newspaper, he is unwillingly distracted by words coming through a nearby open window (that is, “his ears could not help receiving the words”). The words are being perceived specifically by his ears and not his eyes, and ears are the organs of sense with which one hears, so therefore Mr. Spring Fragrance is hearing the words through the open window. Choice A is incorrect because there is no indication in the text that Mr. Spring Fragrance is denying, or refusing the truth of, the words coming to him through the window. He is merely distracted by them. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that Mr. Spring Fragrance’s ears couldn’t help entering, or coming into, the words coming to him through the window. Instead, the text indicates that the opposite occurs: that is, when Mr. Spring Fragrance hears the words, they enter his ears, but his ears don’t enter the words. Choice C is incorrect because it doesn’t make sense in this context to think of Mr. Spring Fragrance as carrying the words coming to him through the window, even though the word “carry” can have a number of different meanings depending on context: for example, he is not lifting them, he is not supporting them, and he is not accepting blame for them (as one “carries the blame” for a mistake)."

In this context, to “simulate” most nearly means to represent a natural process using computer models. According to the text, understanding Earth’s early climate is difficult because we cannot make direct observations of the distant past. Instead, scientists must create computer models that approximate early climate conditions, based on the physical evidence that those conditions left behind on Earth’s surface. This context supports the idea that computer models simulate Earth’s climate in the distant past. Choice A is incorrect because scientists use existing physical evidence as a basis for developing computer models that describe what Earth’s actual past climate might have been like. The models are not being used to “invent,” or imagine, a completely fictional climate. Choice C is incorrect because the computer models are being used in an attempt to describe as accurately as possible what Earth’s past climate might have been like.

Held up | B. Encouraged | C. Improved on | D. Defended,A,"Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, ""supported"" most nearly means held up or sustained physically. The sentence describes the physical structure of the Panhandle bridge, stating it was ""supported by massive sandstone pillars."" This clearly refers to the structural relationship between the bridge and its pillars—the pillars physically hold up the bridge and keep it standing.

Choice B is incorrect. This isn’t what “quality” means in this context. Here, “this quality” refers to Gatsby’s “resourcefulness of movement,” which is described as a characteristic or trait of his. “Prestige” would suggest a high status or an admirable reputation, which doesn’t match that description. Choice D is incorrect. This isn’t what “quality” means in this context.

After further research, Sharif concluded that this dip in life satisfaction mainly occurred when individuals spent all their free time unproductively, such as by watching TV or playing games. Text 2 Psychologist James Maddux cautions against suggesting an ideal amount of free time. The human desire for both free time and productivity is universal, but Maddux asserts that individuals have unique needs for life satisfaction. Furthermore, he points out that there is no objective definition for what constitutes productivity; reading a book might be considered a productive activity by some, but idleness by others.","Based on the texts, how would Maddux (Text 2) most likely respond to the conclusion Sharif (Text 1) reached after her further research?","A. By acknowledging that free time is more likely to enhance life satisfaction when it is spent productively than when it is spent unproductively | B. By challenging the reasoning in Text 1, as it has not been proved that productivity commonly contributes to individuals’ life satisfaction | C. By warning against making an overly broad assumption, as there is no clear consensus in distinguishing between productive and unproductive activities | D. By claiming that the specific activities named in Text 1 are actually examples of productive activities rather than unproductive ones",C,"Choice C is the best answer because it characterizes how Maddux would most likely respond to the conclusion Sharif reached after her research. Text 1 describes Sharif’s study of the benefits of free time, saying that the reported sense of satisfaction plateaued at two hours per day and began to decline at five hours per day. Further research led Sharif to conclude that time spent doing tasks she defines as unproductive, such as watching TV or playing games, correlated with a drop in life satisfaction. However, in Text 2 Maddux says that there is no objective definition of what constitutes productive behavior, giving the example that reading a book might be considered productive by some but unproductive by others. It can be inferred that Maddux would also assert that whether watching TV or playing games is productive or unproductive is a matter of subjective judgment. Thus, Maddux would most likely caution against making an overly broad assumption, as there is no clear consensus in distinguishing between productive and unproductive activities. Choice A is incorrect because Maddux asserts that individuals have unique needs for life satisfaction: some may want to spend that time productively, others unproductively, and what counts as productive is subjective. Therefore, Maddux would likely not consider it universally true that free time is more likely to enhance life satisfaction when it is spent productively. Choice B is incorrect because the study described in Text 1 concerns whether free time contributes to life satisfaction, not whether productivity contributes to life satisfaction. The dip in life satisfaction that Sharif claims to observe in Text 1 happens only after five hours, and mainly if the time is spent unproductively—that is, two hours of free time spent productively might increase life satisfaction just as much as two hours spent unproductively. Choice D is incorrect because Maddux holds the opinion that whether an activity is productive or unproductive is subjective and depends on the individual; therefore, he would most likely claim that watching TV or playing games might be productive for some and unproductive for others."

As used in this context, ""dominance"" means the state of being more successful than others. The text states that the Southern Pacific Railroad already controlled 85% of California’s railways in 1877, and that the Sunset Route it constructed in 1883 was the first transcontinental rail line across the southern United States. Therefore, the Southern Pacific Railroad would be more successful than other railroads in the area, and the construction of the Sunset Route would further solidify its dominance in rail access to California’s coast. Choice B is incorrect. Although the construction of the Sunset Route must have required some creativity, or use of imagination, the word ""creativity"" would not also encompass the fact that the Southern Pacific Railroad already controlled 85% of California’s railways. The text is more focused on the railroad’s control of the field and overall success rather than its imaginative thought processes. Choice C is incorrect because if the Southern Pacific Railroad controlled the majority of California’s railways, it would not make sense to refer to its ""insignificance,"" or the state of being unimportant. Rather, the opposite would be true. Choice D is incorrect because in context it would not make sense to refer to the Southern Pacific Railroad’s ""neutrality,"" or absence of strong opinion on a matter, since no opinions are mentioned. Nor would ""neutrality"" in the sense of impartiality in a conflict be a logical or precise choice since no conflict is explicitly described. There might be an implied conflict between the Southern Pacific Railroad and other railroads doing business in California, but that is not a conflict in which the Southern Pacific Railroad would take an impartial position."

Take into account and follow | B. Admire steadily and praise | C. Come to a decision about | D. Have an opinion on,A,"Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, ""consider"" most nearly means to take into account and follow. The text explains that Marija’s job was to make sure that her sister’s wedding proceeded in certain ways (""in due form"") and that she loudly directed everyone’s actions all day. The text then indicates that Marija was so focused on ensuring that others ""conformed to the proprieties""—that is, that they behaved in appropriate ways—that she failed to ""consider them herself""; that is, she didn’t take standards of appropriate behavior into account and follow them in her own actions. Choice B is incorrect. In some contexts, ""consider"" can mean to think about something in a positive way—which can involve admiration—but the text doesn’t suggest that Marija was so busy imposing ""proprieties"" (standards of appropriate behavior) on others that she didn’t admire and praise them herself. The context suggests it’s more likely that Marija did speak positively of ""due form"" and ""the best home traditions"" while ensuring others behaved in certain ways. Choice C is incorrect. In some contexts, ""consider"" can mean to come to a decision, but the text doesn’t suggest that Marija wasn’t able to make a decision for herself about the ""proprieties"" (standards of appropriate behavior) she ensured everyone else conformed to. Rather, the context conveys that Marija knew very clearly which behaviors others should follow as ""due form"" and ""the best home traditions."" Choice D is incorrect. In some contexts, ""consider"" can mean to have an opinion, but the text doesn’t suggest that Marija wasn’t able to have an opinion on the ""proprieties"" (standards of appropriate behavior) she was ensuring others conformed to. Rather, the context conveys that Marija had strong feelings about which behaviors were ""due form"" and ""the best home traditions."""

The text starts with a general statement that introduces Shannon, then describes a specific contribution from one of his papers, then provides a quote that illustrates just how important this contribution was. Choice A is incorrect. This isn’t the overall structure.

Choice C is incorrect. This isn’t the overall structure. Shannon’s employment at Bell Labs is only mentioned once, very briefly: the text never goes into detail about his career there, and it never mentions any recognition he received there.

Portuguese traders brought cassava from Brazil to the West African coast in the 1500s. But at this time, people living in the capitals further inland had little contact with coastal communities. Thus, cassava remained relatively unknown to most of the region’s inhabitants until the 1800s. Text 2 Cassava’s slow adoption into the diet of West Africans is mainly due to the nature of the crop itself. If not cooked properly, cassava can be toxic. Knowledge of how to properly prepare cassava needed to spread before the food could grow in popularity. The arrival of formerly enslaved people from Brazil in the 1800s, who brought their knowledge of cassava and its preparation with them, thus directly fueled the spread of this crop.","Based on the texts, the author of Text 1 and the author of Text 2 would most likely agree with which statement?",A. Cassava did not become a significant crop in West Africa until long after it was first introduced. | B. Several of the most commonly grown crops in West Africa are originally from Brazil. | C. The climate of the West African coast in the 1500s prevented cassava’s spread in the region. | D. The most commonly used methods to cook cassava today date to the 1500s.,A,"Choice A is the best answer. Text 1 states that cassava’s “rise to popularity was slow” in West Africa. Text 2 also describes cassava’s “slow adoption into the diet of West Africans.” While the two texts identify different causes for this slow adoption, both agree that cassava took a long time to catch on. Choice B is incorrect. This isn’t something that either text claims. Cassava is the only crop discussed in the passages, so we have no basis to draw conclusions about what the authors might say about “several” crops. Choice C is incorrect. This isn’t something that either text claims. Neither text mentions the “climate of the West African coast,” so we have no evidence that either author would agree with this. Choice D is incorrect.

The first sentence describes a unique location on Earth, the Atacama Desert. The next sentence, which is the underlined sentence, states that the reason why astrobiologists study life, or its remains, in this unique location is that Atacama is a harsh environment that closely resembles the extreme environment of Mars. The remainder of the text explains that the researchers hope their work in Atacama will support inquiry into life on Mars. Thus, the underlined portion functions mainly to indicate why astrobiologists choose to conduct research in the Atacama Desert. Choice A is incorrect because to contrast two things means to show the differences between them, and the phrase ""closely mirrors"" in the underlined sentence indicates that the extreme environment in the Atacama Desert is similar to, not different from, that on Mars. This similarity is why, according to the underlined sentence, astrobiologists conduct research in Atacama. Choice B is incorrect because the underlined sentence doesn’t address forms of life that are unable to survive the harsh environment of the Atacama Desert.

Select,B,"Choice B is the best answer because as used in the text ""determine"" most nearly means ""dictate."" The text describes the relationship between the main character and those who exhibit, praise, and purchase his artwork. The text states that the main character is often asked to change his art or himself based on outside influences, and he usually acquiesces.

The text indicates that the researchers are seeking to determine whether there are “considerable variations” in the potency of stingray venom that are associated with variation in the stingrays’ age and sex. This context suggests that the researchers want to find out whether stingray age and sex have a substantial effect on venom toxicity. Choice A is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text that suggests that the researchers have been studying whether the stingrays’ age and sex have “a disconcerting,” or an unsettling and disturbing, effect on the stingrays’ venom. The text indicates that the researchers wish to determine if stingray age and sex cause large variations in the toxicity of stingray venom, not if the effect of age and sex is disconcerting.

This technique involves analyzing the cosmogenic nucleotides in the breccia—the matrix of rock fragments immediately surrounding the fossils. The researchers assert that this approach avoids the potential for misdating associated with assigning ages based on Sterkfontein’s soil layers or animal bones.","Based on the texts, how would the researchers in Text 2 most likely respond to the underlined portion in Text 1?","A. They would emphasize the fact that the A. africanus fossils found in the Sterkfontein Caves may have been corrupted in some way over the years. | B. They would contend that if analyses of surrounding layers and bones in the Sterkfontein Caves were combined, then the dating of the fossils there would be more accurate. | C. They would argue that their techniques are better suited than other methods to the unique challenges posed by the Sterkfontein Caves. | D. They would claim that cosmogenic nuclide dating is reliable in the context of the Sterkfontein Caves because it is applied to the fossils directly.",C,"Choice C is the best answer. Text 2 states that the researchers used cosmogenic nuclide dating to ""avoid the potential for misdating"" caused by the geology of Sterkfontein, which Text 1 describes as ""challenging"" and unreliable. Choice A is incorrect. Neither text suggests that the A. africanus fossils have been ""corrupted,"" but only that traditional dating methods are difficult in Sterkfontein because of floods and soil mixing where the fossils were found. Nothing is implied to have compromised the fossils themselves. Choice B is incorrect. This choice misreads Text 2. Text 2 agrees that stratigraphy and other methods are prone to error in the context of Sterkfontein: there’s a ""potential for misdating"" when evaluating age based on soil layers and bones. Choice D is incorrect. Text 2 does not state that cosmogenic nuclide dating is applied to the fossils directly but rather to the breccia that surrounds them."

In this context, “ensuring” means guaranteeing, or making sure of, the cucurbits’ survival. The text states that cucurbits faced extinction in the past because their means of seed dispersal disappeared, but the ancestors of Indigenous peoples in North America began farming cucurbits around that same time, so the crops were no longer threatened. Therefore, the context supports the idea that the ancestors of Indigenous peoples in North America helped with ensuring the cucurbits’ survival. Choice A is incorrect because in this context verifying means making sure that something is accurate. In the text, the ancestors of Indigenous peoples in North America were ensuring the survival, not the accuracy of, the cucurbits. Choice B is incorrect. Although the cucurbit crops themselves were multiplying, or growing in number, as a result of the work of the ancestors of Indigenous peoples in North America, it wouldn’t make sense in context to say that the survival of the plants was multiplying. Choice C is incorrect because according to the text, in raising cucurbits as crops, the ancestors of Indigenous peoples in North America were attempting to help the plants grow and survive; they weren’t attempting to comfort, or free the plants from pain."

The text after the semicolon tells us that Hu ""identif[ied] broad similarities between two seemingly different phenomena,"" comparing ants with light particles. Since an analogy seeks similarities between seemingly unrelated phenomena, this fits the context perfectly. Choice A is incorrect. ""A collaboration"" refers to ""an act of working with others,"" but what comes after the semicolon doesn’t describe collaboration with other researchers. Instead, it shows a comparison between two different (but ultimately similar) scientific phenomena. Choice B is incorrect. ""An accessory"" can refer to ""something added to increase attractiveness or usefulness."" No accessories are described in this text. Choice C is incorrect.

In this context, ""contingent on"" means conditional upon, or determined by. The text indicates that different ways of balancing elements in a photograph convey different ideas to viewers (for example, symmetrical composition tends to emphasize similarity among elements, whereas asymmetry tends to emphasize difference). Thus, there is a strong connection between what a photograph conveys and how its elements are balanced. Therefore, what a photo conveys is contingent on how it is balanced. Choice A is incorrect. In this context, ""inhibited by"" most nearly means hindered or undermined by. The text indicates that different ways of balancing elements in a photograph convey different ideas to viewers, thereby indicating a relationship between image balance and what is conveyed. Although this explanation is consistent with a photographer choosing asymmetrical balance even while intending to convey similarity (associated with symmetrical balance), there is nothing to indicate that messages generally are inhibited by balance. Rather the implication is that balance is a tool photographers can use to craft their messages. Choice C is incorrect. In this context, ""obligated to"" means duty bound toward or answerable to. In context, it would not make sense to assert that a photograph’s message is obligated to how that photograph is balanced. Choice D is incorrect. In this context, ""reserved for"" most nearly means solely available to someone or held aside for some purpose. The text as a whole does not support the claim that a photograph’s message is reserved for how that photograph is balanced."

Perhaps ten-year-old John was puzzling to the folk there in the Florida woods for he was an imaginative child and fond of day-dreams. The St. John River flowed a scarce three hundred feet from his back door. On its banks at this point grow numerous palms, luxuriant magnolias and bay trees.

It provides an extended description of a location that John likes to visit. | B. It reveals that some residents of John’s town are confused by his behavior. | C. It illustrates the uniqueness of John’s imagination compared to the imaginations of other children. | D. It suggests that John longs to experience a larger life outside the Florida woods.,D,"Choice D is the best answer because it accurately describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The text establishes that John has a strong imagination and then goes on to describe the St. John River near John’s home in the Florida woods. The underlined sentence depicts John sending twigs sailing down the river while he imagines them reaching “Jacksonville, the sea, the wide world,” where he wishes he could follow. This suggests that John longs to expand his life experiences beyond the Florida woods. Choice A is incorrect because the second and third sentences of the text provide an extended description of the riverbank where John likes to go, whereas the underlined sentence describes what John does at that location. Choice B is incorrect because the first sentence of the text suggests that John’s behavior “was puzzling” to others around him, whereas the underlined sentence concerns the content of John’s imaginings.

To reveal how the predictability of the town makes it easy for people lose track of time | D. To argue that the simplicity of life in the town makes it a pleasant place to live,A,"Choice A is the best answer. The author describes Coketown as having streets that are all very similar and residents who live similarly and do the same work. This repetition of similarities emphasizes how everything in Coketown is alike. Choice B is incorrect. While the text mentions that all the residents “do the same work,” it never explains what that work is or why everyone does it. Besides, the idea that they all do the same work is just one of several similarities among the townspeople described in the text. Choice C is incorrect. While the last sentence states that “every day was the same as yesterday and tomorrow, and every year the counterpart of the last and the next,” it never suggests that people actually “lose track of time.” This is also too narrow to be the main idea, since time is just one of many aspects of Coketown that the text describes as always being the same. Choice D is incorrect. The text never mentions whether life is simple in Coketown, and the town sounds as though it’s probably a pretty dull place to live, rather than a pleasant one."

As used in this context, ""inconsequential to"" means not significant to. According to the text, Ibn Rushd’s works were primarily available in Spain, where he lived, far from central areas of the Muslim world, a fact that could support the conclusion that his influence on Muslim contemporaries was limited. The text implies, however, that recent scholarship has shown that his works still had an impact on other Muslim philosophers of his time. This context supports the idea that his works weren’t inconsequential to Islamic thought in this period. Choice A is incorrect because the issue under consideration in the text is whether other Muslim philosophers of Ibn Rushd’s time had access to his works, not whether his works were ""controversial among,"" or causing dispute among, other philosophers. Choice B is incorrect. The text implies that other Muslim philosophers of Ibn Rushd’s era were aware of his works, not that they were ""antagonistic toward,"" or hostile toward, them. There is no suggestion that Ibn Rushd’s writings elicited hostility from his contemporaries. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, ""imitated by"" would mean followed as a model by. Although the text implies that Ibn Rushd’s works were at least somewhat available in regions that were at the center of Islamic thought during the period, it doesn’t specifically address in what ways his works influenced contemporary Muslim philosophers. Thus, the text doesn’t support the idea that other philosophers modeled their own works after Ibn Rushd’s works."

As used in this context, “buttress” means to strengthen or defend. The text indicates that regardless of whether a French monarch’s reign was significant or uneventful, each monarch faced questions about his right to the throne. The text goes on to say that in order to understand the path of a French monarch’s reign, it’s important to understand what contributed to the monarch’s ability to “hold the throne.” This context suggests that French monarchs such as Hugh Capet and Henry I had to buttress, or defend, their right to be monarch. Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to discuss factors that enabled a monarch to “disengage,” or withdraw his right to the French throne. The text focuses on an examination of people who reigned as French monarchs, not on people who didn’t choose to rule. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to discuss factors that enabled a monarch to “annotate,” or add notes to or explain, his right to the French throne. Nothing in the text suggests that the monarchs were writing notes about their right to the throne; instead, faced with questions about the legitimacy of their reign, the monarchs defended their right. Choice D is incorrect. Saying that a monarch who is faced with questions about the legitimacy of his reign was able to “reciprocate” his right to the French throne would mean that he either returned his right to the throne or that he responded in kind to the challenge. Neither of these meanings would make sense in context because the text focuses on people who did reign as French monarchs and defended their right to do so."

The text introduces the silversword alliance as a family of plants unique to the Hawaiian Islands, presenting those that mature into vines and those that mature into shrubs and trees as examples of different phenotypes. The text concludes by explaining that these plants are all descendants of ""a single ancestral tarweed plant"" that arrived 5 million years ago in the Hawaiian Islands, where a ""wide variety of habitats"" drove the plant’s descendants to adapt and thus differentiate themselves, diversifying into a group of related but distinct species with different physical characteristics. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text explains why the plants within the silversword alliance have varied physical characteristics, the text doesn’t suggest that tarweed is the ancestor of all plants on the Hawaiian Islands. The text states instead that all members of the silversword alliance descend from a single tarweed ancestor. Choice B is incorrect because while Dubautia carrii is mentioned as an example of a species in the silversword alliance, no details about its particular habitat are provided. And although the text indicates that the Hawaiian Islands are home to ""a wide variety of habitats,"" it doesn’t describe the specific habitat where Dubautia carrii is found. The text discusses the silversword alliance as a whole rather than focusing on Dubautia carrii or any one species within this family. Choice D is incorrect. Although the silversword alliance is only found on the Hawaiian Islands and includes ""an extraordinary range of phenotypes,"" the text doesn’t claim that all plants on the Hawaiian Islands are part of the alliance.

In this context, ""supposition"" refers to an assumption or hypothesis that is not yet proven. The text explains that text corpora can be used for ""empirical testing of hypotheses regarding the frequency of typical word usage"" and then provides a specific example of using corpus analysis to support a claim about the word ""get."" The word ""supposition"" precisely conveys this idea of an assumption or hypothesis about word frequency that can then be tested against empirical data. Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that someone has a ""recognition"" that the word ""get"" has a high incidence in English. Recognition implies acknowledging something already established as true or valid, but the text indicates that corpus analysis is needed to support the claim about ""get,"" suggesting its high frequency wasn’t already established or previously known. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that someone has a ""scheme"" that the word ""get"" has a high incidence in English. A scheme is a plan or systematic arrangement, but the context indicates what’s needed is a preliminary hypothesis that can be tested with corpus data, not a plan related to word frequency. Choice D is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that someone has a ""synopsis"" that the word ""get"" has a high incidence in English. A synopsis is a summary or outline, but the text is discussing an initial hypothesis about word frequency that requires testing, not a condensed statement of existing information."

Choice A is incorrect. The passage tells us that examining an item’s age is the best way to predict how much longer it will last. Therefore, according to Taleb’s theory, an item’s age should add more certainty about how much longer it will last. Choice C is incorrect. A “motivation” is “a reason for doing.” Items don’t have feelings and motivations, so it wouldn’t make sense to say that their age is a motivation for how much longer they will last.

Text 2 discusses how the inconsistent use of credits to identify the contributors to video games can pose an obstacle to scholars of the medium, who rely on such credits to answer questions about the medium’s development. Text 1 notes that in film and television, on the other hand, credits are used consistently and are valuable to researchers studying the cast and crew members in these mediums. Since Text 1 asserts how the consistent use of credits benefits scholars of film and television, it can be inferred that this text’s author would respond to the discussion in Text 2 by observing that the kind of problem faced by scholars of video games—the inability to know who contributed to a particular production and how—is, in film and television studies, largely prevented by the widespread practice of credits in these mediums. Choice A is incorrect. Although Text 1 discusses a method used by film and television researchers—namely, relying on credits to research the careers of cast and crew members—the author doesn’t explicitly recommend that or any other method. Moreover, Text 1 states that films and television shows themselves, not their researchers, regularly use the method of listing credits. Choice B is incorrect. It can be inferred from Text 2 that when video games do feature credits, they have essentially the same function as credits in film and television—namely, to identify the individuals who worked on a particular production. Therefore, it is unlikely that the author of Text 1 would characterize video game credits as differing in purpose from film and television credits. Choice C is incorrect because, as Text 2 explains, credits are not consistently used in video games. Therefore, it is unlikely that the author of Text 1 would argue that scholars of the medium discussed in this text—video games—rely more heavily on credits than scholars of film and television, two mediums where credits consistently appear."

In this context, ""nullify"" most nearly means negate or undermine. The text indicates that importing goods to a country can reduce consumer prices in that country, then cautions that the costs of transporting goods within the country is also a factor. These transportation costs likely raise the prices that must be paid by people who live far from the ports of entry. Therefore, the intranational transportation costs could nullify the price advantages to consumers of importing goods. Choice B is incorrect. In this context, ""denigrate"" would most nearly mean disparage or deny the importance of. Since transportation costs would not be capable of denying the importance of price advantages, it would not make sense to state that intranational transportation costs denigrate the price advantages of importing goods. Choice C is incorrect. In this context, ""underestimate"" would most nearly mean predict a lower value for, or to undervalue, someone or something. Though transportation costs might be undervalued, they cannot themselves undervalue something else, so it would not make sense to state that intranational transportation costs underestimate the price advantages of importing goods.

In this context, ""inspired by"" means influenced by or motivated by. The text refers to how, regardless of the scale of the work, Garza uses her memories of Texas and details from California to create her art. If Garza is basing her work on her direct experiences, then they play a part in her artistic process. This context thus suggests that Garza’s art is inspired by the experiences of her childhood in Texas and her current life in California. Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn’t make logical sense to indicate that Garza is ""complimented by""—or praised by—something inanimate such as direct experience. Choice B is incorrect because describing Garza as ""uncertain about""—or unsure or doubtful of—direct experience would suggest that she had misgivings about it. If Garza were unsure of her experiences, that would suggest that she couldn’t recall them, and Garza wouldn’t be able to represent direct experience in her art if she were uncertain of the memories or details.

But in my soul The eastern billows roll— I hear the voices of my native strands.,Which choice best describes the function of the underlined lines in the text as a whole?,"A. It establishes that the speaker’s enthusiasm about current travels conflicts with the growing urge to return home. | B. It illustrates the speaker’s uncertainty about maintaining strong links with relatives in distant places. | C. It conveys the speaker’s sense of feeling a pull toward home while traveling in an unfamiliar place. | D. It reveals that upon returning after an extended absence, the speaker longs for the way a location once felt.",C,"Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes the function of the underlined lines in the text as a whole. In the opening line of the text, the speaker describes wandering in ""alien lands,"" which establishes that the speaker is traveling in unfamiliar territory. In the underlined lines, the speaker describes ""billows"" (large waves) rolling in the soul, which suggests that the speaker feels inner turmoil. The underlined lines go on to associate these rolling billows with voices calling to the speaker from the speaker’s ""native strands,"" or homeland, indicating that thoughts of home are prompting the emotional experience these lines describe. Taken together, the imagery in the underlined lines thus implies that the speaker feels a deep emotional connection to, or pull toward, home while traveling in an unfamiliar place. Choice A is incorrect. While the text’s first line states that the speaker is traveling and the underlined lines indicate that the speaker experiences an emotional pull toward home, neither the underlined lines nor the text as a whole establishes an enthusiasm about the current travels that conflicts with a growing urge to return home. The text’s description of the lands the speaker is traveling in focuses on their artificial quality, stating, ""Nature her prerogative resigns / To Man,"" which doesn’t suggest enthusiasm but rather a sense of detachment or even critique. Choice B is incorrect because the underlined lines don’t address uncertainty about maintaining links with relatives in distant places. In the underlined lines, the speaker expresses a sense of connection to the speaker’s homeland (""native strands"") but doesn’t refer to any family members the speaker may have there or to concerns about maintaining any familial ties. Choice D is incorrect because the poem doesn’t indicate that the speaker has returned home after an absence. Rather, the speaker explicitly states, ""I wander among the hills of alien lands,"" establishing that the current setting is a foreign place. Moreover, the underlined lines express a sense of connection with, or pull toward, a distant homeland, not a sense of longing for how that homeland or any other location once felt."

With so many consumer options, organizers are finding ways to cement festival attendance as a special experience worth sharing. This phenomenon is linked to the growing “experiential economy,” where many find it gratifying to purchase lived experiences. To ensure a profitable event, venues need to consider the overall consumer experience, not just the band lineup. Text 2 Music festival appearances are becoming a more important part of musicians’ careers. One factor in this shift is the rising use of streaming services that allow access to huge numbers of songs for a monthly fee, subsequently reducing sales of full-length albums. With this shift in consumer behavior, musicians are increasingly dependent on revenue from live performances.","Based on the texts, both authors would most likely agree with which statement?",A. Consumers are more interested in paying subscription fees to stream music than in attending music festivals in person. | B. Consumers’ growing interest in purchasing experiences is mostly confined to the music industry. | C. Changing consumer behaviors are leading to changes in music-related businesses. | D. The rising consumer demand for live music festivals also generates higher demand for music streaming platforms.,C,"Choice C is the best answer. Both authors mention how consumer behaviors have shifted, and how this affects different aspects of the music industry. Text 1 states that consumers enjoy purchasing “lived experiences,” and that this influences how organizers design music festivals. Text 2 states that consumers are using streaming services more, and that this reduces album sales and increases the importance of live performances for musicians. Choice A is incorrect. Neither text claims that consumers prefer streaming to festivals, or that these are mutually exclusive options. Text 1 implies that festivals are popular and profitable, and Text 2 never suggests that streaming services diminish the demand for live music. Choice B is incorrect. This choice misreads Text 1, which identifies music festivals as just one example of a broader trend of purchasing “lived experiences.” Text 2 doesn’t mention growing interest in purchasing experiences, in the music industry or otherwise. Choice D is incorrect. Neither text establishes a cause/effect relationship between the demand for festivals and the demand for streaming platforms. Text 1 does not mention streaming platforms at all, and Text 2 does not imply that streaming platforms benefit from the popularity of festivals."

In this context, “implement” means to carry out or put into effect. The text states that the National Council generates laws, while the principal chief and cabinet officials are responsible for “devising policies and administering services in accordance with” those laws. This context suggests that the principal chief and cabinet officials implement the laws: they put the laws into effect by creating policies and administering services that accord with those laws. Choice B is incorrect because “presume” in this context would mean to assume based on incomplete information, and the text does not suggest that the principal chief and cabinet officials either made assumptions about the content of the laws or had incomplete information about them. Choice C is incorrect because in this context “improvise” would mean to create something without preparation, and the text does not suggest that the principal chief and cabinet officials create policies and administer services without advance preparation. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the principal chief and cabinet officials “mimic,” or imitate, the laws generated by the National Council. To mimic laws would mean to generate new laws that are imitations of existing laws, but the text indicates that the National Council, not the principal chief and cabinet officials, is responsible for generating laws. Instead of generating laws, the principal chief and cabinet officials put laws into effect by “devising policies and administering services in accordance with” the laws."

When she sat or stood in the midst of a circle and began to invent wonderful things, her green eyes grew big and shining, her cheeks flushed, and, without knowing that she was doing it, she began to act and made what she told lovely or alarming by the raising or dropping of her voice.","As used in the text, what does the word “invent” most nearly mean?",A. Mislead | B. Disguise | C. Create | D. Discover,C,"Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text, ""invent"" most nearly means create or make up. The text begins by stating that Sara likes to tell stories and thoroughly enjoys telling them. The rest of the text describes how she looks and acts when she invents, or creates, ""wonderful things"" in her stories (""what she told""). Choice A is incorrect. Although the text suggests that Sara makes up ""wonderful things,"" nothing suggests that she does so to mislead, or intentionally deceive, others; there is no reason to assume that Sara’s listeners don’t know that she’s creating the stories she shares. Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Sara is disguising, or trying to cover up or conceal, ""wonderful things"" when she tells stories; rather, she is creating them and presenting them in ways that make them ""lovely or alarming"" for her listeners.

In this context, “overcome” means to succeed in dealing with an obstacle. The text suggests that although it’s difficult to move biomolecules through plant cell walls, Landry and her colleagues have shown that carbon nanotubes may be useful, since they can cross cell walls. This context conveys that Landry and her colleagues think it’s possible, using carbon nanotubes, to succeed in dealing with the obstacle of transmitting biomolecules to plant cells. Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to say that Landry and her colleagues have shown that it may be possible to “conceptualize,” or form an idea of, the difficulty of transmitting biomolecules through the walls of plant cells. The text presents this difficulty as a known problem that Landry and her colleagues think they may have solved, not as a mysterious occurrence that they have yet to form ideas about. Choice B is incorrect because the text suggests that Landry and her colleagues think it may be possible to successfully deal with the problem of transmitting biomolecules through the walls of plant cells, not that Landry and her colleagues think it may be possible to “neglect,” or simply to disregard and ignore the problem. Choice C is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to say that Landry and her colleagues have shown that it may be possible to “illustrate,” or demonstrate, the difficulty of transmitting biomolecules through the walls of plant cells by using carbon nanotubes. According to the text, carbon nanotubes allow molecules to be transmitted to plant cells—something that is otherwise difficult to do.

As used in this context, “intersect” means to connect or overlap. The text indicates that Jamie Okuma challenges the position held by critics because her work can be seen at an art museum and can be bought by the public from her online boutique. The text also presents the critics’ view as being influenced by a perception that fine artists create works that are “timeless” and meant for exhibition, whereas fashion designers periodically produce new styles that are meant for purchase. This context suggests that the critics believe that fine art and fashion tend not to overlap—in other words, that they rarely intersect. Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to say that critics contend that fine art and fashion rarely “prevail,” or prove to be triumphant or widespread. The text indicates that Okuma is an example of an artist who demonstrates that it’s possible to make fine art that is also available to the public as fashion. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to say that fine art and fashion rarely “succumb,” or surrender. The text establishes that unlike what critics believe, Okuma creates works that are in art museums and available for the public to purchase, suggesting that critics believe fine art and fashion rarely overlap, not that they rarely succumb. Choice C is incorrect because saying that critics believe that fine art and fashion rarely “diverge,” or disagree or move in different directions, wouldn’t make sense in context. The text presents Okuma’s work as both fine art and fashion, thereby undermining what the critics assert.

The text states that manul cats live in ""out-of-the-way parts of Asia"" (citing the famously remote Mount Everest as an example) and indicates that it is difficult to research the cats because of the location of their habitats. By emphasizing that the habitats are remote in relation to humans, the text conveys that being ""distant from,"" or far from, large groups of humans makes manul cats challenging to study. Choice A is incorrect because saying that the habitats of manul cats are ""full of large populations of humans"" would indicate that the cats cohabitate with many humans, which would directly contradict the text’s claim that the cats live in ""out-of-the-way"" areas. Choice B is incorrect because the missing words describe an aspect of manul cats’ habitats, or the areas where they live, and it wouldn’t make sense to say that areas could be ""drawn to,"" or attracted by, large groups of humans.

It introduces an observation of a behavioral pattern, presents an explanation for the pattern, and then describes an exception to the pattern that casts doubt on that explanation.",B,"Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes the overall structure of the text. The text begins by describing a study’s finding about greater short-nosed fruit bats—namely, that high moonlight intensity inhibits the bats’ activity—and also accounts for that finding, stating that this occurs because the potential increase in foraging success that greater lunar intensity enables doesn’t offset these bats’ increased vulnerability to predators (whose vision is also implied to become more acute under intense moonlight). The text goes on to characterize this finding as representative of a general pattern, stating that many nocturnal mammals behave similarly in response to changes in lunar intensity. The text concludes by describing an exception to this pattern, explaining that mongoose lemurs display an opposite tendency because they rely heavily on visual foraging. This strategy presumably would allow them to derive more benefit from greater lunar intensity than many other nocturnal mammals would, resulting in a ""different balance of reward and risk"" than exists for other nocturnal mammals. Therefore, the overall structure of the text is best described as a description and account of a finding, a characterization of that finding as representative of a pattern, and then a description and account of an exception to that pattern. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text discusses two different responses to variations in moonlight intensity, explaining that as moonlight intensity increases, greater short-nosed fruit bats and many other nocturnal mammals decrease their foraging activity but mongoose lemurs increase their foraging activity, it doesn’t leave one of these responses unexplained. The text accounts for both the typical response to increased lunar intensity (reduced activity due to predation risk) and the exception (increased activity due to a reliance on visual foraging) by making reference to a cost-benefit framework. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text presents a study′s finding about the effect of increased lunar intensity on greater short-nosed fruit bats’ activity before going on to contrast this behavior with the fact that mongoose lemurs display the opposite response to increased lunar intensity, the text doesn’t explicitly invoke other studies and doesn’t attribute this difference in observed behavior to the fact that the study of greater short-nosed fruit bats used different methods than studies of mongoose lemurs did. Rather, the text explains that the different observed behaviors can be attributed to differences in species’ foraging strategies. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text characterizes the behavior of mongoose lemurs in response to increased lunar intensity as an exception to a pattern of behavior observed in other nocturnal mammal species, this exception doesn’t cast any doubt on the explanation that is offered for the general pattern observed among other species. Instead, the text uses the same cost-benefit framework to explain why increased lunar intensity is associated with decreased activity by greater short-nosed fruit bats and other nocturnal mammals but with increased activity by mongoose lemurs."

In this context, ""inexpensive"" means less costly or low in price. The passage describes two kinds of methods that can be used to ""detect objects or people through walls"": radar and sonar, and changes to the Wi-Fi technology used in smartphones. The word ""comparatively"" before the blank indicates that the best answer would be one that helps to describe a comparison between the two. Radar and sonar are described as ""costly,"" while the method that uses Wi-Fi technology is described as ""cheap""; therefore, it would be comparatively affordable, or inexpensive. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that a small modification to the smartphones that many consumers already own would presumably result in consumers using that technology to detect objects or people through walls more regularly, or frequently; therefore, it would not be true that such technology would be comparatively infrequent, or uncommon. Choice C is incorrect because there is nothing in the text to indicate that either radar and sonar or changes to smartphone Wi-Fi technology are capable of being misunderstood or mistaken for something else; therefore, it would not make sense to describe changes to Wi-Fi smartphone technology as comparatively unmistakable, or indisputable.

To argue that Indigenous politicians in the United States should form their own political party | C. To highlight two approaches to achieving political representation for Indigenous people | D. To consider how Indigenous politicians in the United States have influenced Indigenous politicians in Canada and Latin America,C,"Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text, which is to illustrate two approaches that Indigenous politicians have taken to achieve political representation for their communities. The text begins by explaining that one approach is exemplified by Indigenous politicians in the United States who, in an effort to ensure that the interests of their communities are represented in government, joined preexisting political parties and were subsequently elected to Congress. The text goes on to highlight a second approach adopted by Indigenous leaders in Canada and several Latin American countries: rather than joining established political parties, many Indigenous politicians in these countries have instead formed their own parties to promote candidates for office who support causes that are important to their communities. Choice A is incorrect because the text’s focus is on the contrasting approaches adopted by different Indigenous political movements in different countries; thus, it isn’t accurate to say that the text traces the history of one political movement. Moreover, the text only discusses examples from 2000 to 2021, a relatively short period of time; therefore, it provides very little in the way of discussion of larger historical developments, nor does it make any predictions about how these movements might continue to develop in the future. Choice B is incorrect because the text never urges Indigenous politicians in the US to alter their strategy of striving for representation through the established political parties, nor does it suggest that this strategy is inferior to that of Indigenous politicians in Canada and Latin America, who have formed their own parties. In fact, the text notes that both strategies have resulted in the election of Indigenous politicians to national governments. Choice D is incorrect because the text never suggests that Indigenous politicians in the US have influenced those in Canada and Latin America; instead, it stresses how Indigenous politicians’ approach toward achieving representation in the US government has differed from the approach Indigenous politicians have taken to achieve representation in national governments elsewhere in the Americas."

Back home there had been no place much worth going to, except church and one or two people’s houses.",Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?,A. It illustrates a character’s reaction to a new environment. | B. It explains why a character has traveled to a city. | C. It compares a character’s thoughts about an event at two different times of day. | D. It presents a character feeling regret over leaving home.,A,"Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text. The narrator describes how Joe responds to being in “the metropolis”: he’s excited and “wild with enthusiasm.” He also envies the young fellows who walk by because, dressed as they are, they look as if they have somewhere special to go. The text contrasts this new place with the place Joe comes from, where apparently there wasn’t as much to do. Thus, the main purpose of the text is to illustrate Joe’s reaction to a new environment. Choice B is incorrect because the text makes no reference to why Joe has moved. The narrator indicates that Joe is enthusiastic about being in a city, but there’s no explanation provided for the move. Choice C is incorrect because the text makes no reference to how Joe thinks about an event. The narrator describes young men passing by in the evening and then recalls places worth going to at home—church and a few people’s houses—but there’s no explicit comparison made nor is a time of day mentioned for these events back home. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t support the idea that Joe feels regret over leaving home. Instead, Joe is described as “wild with enthusiasm” at being in the city. Joe’s home is mentioned, but only to compare it unfavorably with the city."

This suggests that playing recordings of a healthy ocean reef may encourage oysters to create such a reef.",Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?,A. responsive | B. inactive | C. liked | D. distressed,A,"Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of oysters and ocean recordings. As used in this context, ""responsive"" means reacting positively. The text presents a finding and describes it as suggesting that healthy ocean sounds may encourage oyster larvae to establish a reef (a permanent home): groups of oyster larvae that heard recorded sounds of a healthy oyster reef were two times more likely to show signs of forming their own reef than groups that heard different ocean recordings were. This context conveys that the groups that heard healthy reef sounds had a more positive reaction than the other groups did—that is, they were the most responsive. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t indicate that hearing sounds of a healthy oyster reef caused some groups of oyster larvae to become ""inactive,"" or to stop engaging in work or activity. Instead, the text conveys that the groups that heard those sounds were observed engaging in activity: they were two times more likely to create a reef (a permanent home) than groups that heard different ocean sounds were. Choice C is incorrect because describing the groups of oyster larvae that heard sounds of a healthy oyster reef as most ""liked,"" or regarded with pleasure, wouldn’t make sense in context. The text focuses on the idea that a study found that healthy reef sounds may encourage groups of oyster larvae to form reefs (permanent homes), not on the idea that some of the groups in the study were liked more than others. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t indicate that hearing sounds of a healthy oyster reef caused some groups of oyster larvae to be ""distressed,"" or to experience difficulty or begin to decline. Instead, the text indicates that the sounds increased the likelihood that groups of larvae would establish a reef (a permanent home), suggesting that the sounds had a positive effect on the larvae."

[A] younger and less cautious man would long since have spoken. But he had made up his mind, and had only to determine the time when he would ask her to be his wife. He decided to give a ball in her honor, and at some time during the evening of the ball to offer her his heart and hand.","As used in the text, what does the word “determine” most nearly mean?",A. Choose | B. Influence | C. Demonstrate | D. Measure,A,"Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, ""determine"" most nearly means choose or decide. The text indicates that Mr. Ryder ""had made up his mind"" to ask a woman to marry him but had not yet ""spoken""—that is, he had not yet asked her. The text also indicates that Mr. Ryder ""decided"" to throw a party for the woman and ask her during it. This context conveys that after making up his mind to propose, what Mr. Ryder had to do was determine, or choose, the time to do it. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, ""determine"" doesn’t mean influence, or affect or control. The text isn’t indicating that Mr. Ryder is controlling time itself; such a thing isn’t possible. Rather, the text conveys that after making up his mind to ask a woman to marry him, Mr. Ryder had to make another decision about his own actions by selecting a time to propose. Choice C is incorrect. The text focuses on Mr. Ryder’s plan to ask a woman to marry him and his decision about when to ask her. This context conveys that after making up his mind to propose, Mr. Ryder had to choose the time, not that he had to demonstrate, or show, the time; it’s not clear what it would mean to demonstrate a time. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, ""determine"" doesn’t mean measure, or control with careful restraint. The text isn’t indicating that Mr. Ryder is carefully controlling time itself; such a thing isn’t possible. Rather, the text conveys that after making up his mind to ask a woman to marry him, Mr. Ryder had to make another decision about his own actions by selecting a time to propose; it’s Mr. Ryder’s decision that is measured, not the time he eventually chooses."

In this context, “enthusiasm for” means excitement about. The text explains that Blind Spot consists of original photographs as well as poetic prose—two elements that correspond to Cole’s passions, identified in the text, for photography and the written word. This context suggests that Cole’s excitement about photography and writing led him to create a book that successfully combines the two mediums. Choice A is incorrect because describing Cole as feeling “indifference to” his two passions wouldn’t make sense in context. If Cole is indifferent to his passions, that would mean he doesn’t care about photography or writing—in which case they wouldn’t be his passions at all. Choice C is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that Cole feels “concern about,” or uneasiness about, his passions. The text’s use of the word “culminates” indicates that Blind Spot represents a triumphant climax of Cole’s passions, not a work that results from his sense of discomfort with photography and writing. Choice D is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that Cole feels “surprise at,” or astonished by, his passions. The text indicates that Cole’s feeling about his passions “culminates” in a book that “evocatively” combines photographs and writing, suggesting that Cole has a long-standing and skillful relationship to his passions, not that he is startled by them."

At night the wide and level stretch of wold, Which at high noon had basked in quiet gold, Far as the eye could see was ghostly white; Dark was the night save for the snow’s weird light. I drew the shades far down, crept into bed; Hearing the cold wind moaning overhead Through the sad pines, my soul, catching its pain, Went sorrowing with it across the plain.","As used in the text, what does the word “drew” most nearly mean?",A. Pulled | B. Drained | C. Inspired | D. Sketched,A,"Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, “drew” most nearly means pulled. In the text, the speaker stands at a window, looking out on a landscape at night. The speaker then “drew the shades far down, crept into bed.” That is, the speaker pulled down, or lowered, the shades until they were completely shut before going to sleep. Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts, “drew” can refer to draining or removing liquid, especially water, as when someone draws water from a well, in this context it refers to the speaker pulling down window shades for the night. Choice C is incorrect. In some contexts, “drew” can be used to describe how a person or thing inspires, or elicits, a response from someone, as when a performer draws applause from an audience. But in this context it refers to the speaker pulling down window shades for the night. Choice D is incorrect. Although “drew” has several meanings, including sketched, or illustrated with a pen or pencil, in this context it refers to the speaker pulling down window shades for the night."

To give a brief overview of public access to libraries throughout Rome’s republican period | B. To contend that early imperial leaders in Rome wielded too much influence over libraries | C. To assert that private and early public libraries in ancient Rome had an essential similarity | D. To call into question the notion that private Roman libraries disappeared during the first century BCE,C,"Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text. The text describes two types of libraries in first-century BCE Rome—private libraries controlled by wealthy individuals, and the public libraries like that commissioned by Emperor Augustus—and then notes that ""these two traditions aren’t as distinct as they seem."" It explains that both private-library owners and the emperor saw their libraries as ""extensions of their personal patronage, just on vastly differing scales,"" because the emperor’s patronage extended to the whole citizenry of Rome. Thus, both private and public libraries in ancient Rome were fundamentally tied to relevant principles of patronage. Choice A is incorrect because the text mentions that Rome’s republican period only to say that it ""ended in the first century BCE,"" thus it doesn’t support any conclusions about possible occurrences ""throughout Rome’s republican period."" Choice B is incorrect. The text neither discusses ""early imperial leaders in Rome,"" nor whether their level of influence was appropriate. Rather it discusses the end of ""Rome’s republican period"" in relation to libraries, who created them, and who got to use them without passing judgment on propriety. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text indicates that Rome’s republican period ""ended in the first century BCE,"" a period that also saw the first public library come into use (28 BCE), nothing in the text suggests that private libraries disappeared at that time."

To convey how engaging in song makes the speaker feel | B. To compare the speaker to a singing shepherd | C. To portray the speaker’s excitement about farming | D. To describe the pieces of music the speaker enjoys hearing,A,"Choice A is the best answer because is accurately states the main purpose of the text. The text begins by declaring that although a song is ""but a little thing,"" or seemingly insignificant, singing it brings joy and gives the speaker of the text ""zest,"" or excitement, in ""hours of toil."" The remainder of the text explores the idea that as night is falling, singing allows the speaker to feel that ""all is well."" Thus, the main purpose of the text is to convey how engaging in song makes the speaker feel. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text mentions a shepherd, it neither indicates that the shepherd is singing nor does it compare the shepherd to the speaker. Choice C is incorrect. The text indicates that the speaker works hard, engaging in ""hours of toil,"" and it can be inferred that the speaker likely lives in a rural area, since cows and a cowbell can be heard nearby. However, the text does not suggest that the speaker is a farmer or feels excited about farming. Moreover, the shepherd in the text is not a literal reference to someone who herds sheep but instead a figurative description of the moon as the shepherd of the stars. Choice D is incorrect because in the text, the speaker is singing a song, not listening to others sing one. Moreover, the text describes the feelings that the speaker has when singing a song, not the song itself."

As used in this context, “disparate” means distinct or dissimilar. The text indicates that a tension exists among the styles that have influenced Cannon’s work and goes on to describe how those styles differ: classic European portraiture favors realism, American pop art uses vivid colors, and intertribal flatstyle rejects the use of shading and perspective to achieve depth. This context suggests that the styles that have influenced Cannon’s work are disparate. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that there is a tension among the influences on Cannon’s artwork, so it wouldn’t make sense to say that the influences are “complementary,” or that they complete one another or make up for one another’s deficiencies. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to characterize Cannon’s influences as “unknown,” or not familiar; it’s clear that the influences are known because the text goes on to list them. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that there is a tension among the influences on Cannon’s work, not that they are “interchangeable,” or capable of being used in one another’s place."

It illustrates that a fire provides comfort beyond physical warmth. | B. It summarizes the information that came before it in the text. | C. It explains that the house remains cold even in summer. | D. It suggests that the author feels comfortable in her home with or without a fire.,A,"Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined portion functions in the text as a whole. The first two sentences of the text establish that in California, houses were heated by building fires year-round. The underlined portion then indicates that the fires didn’t merely provide physical warmth: they also represented being ""home"" and feeling protected. The underlined portion thus illustrates that a fire provides comfort beyond physical warmth. Choice B is incorrect because the underlined portion doesn’t summarize information that came before it. Whereas the previous two sentences describe fires’ ability to provide physical warmth to homes, the underlined portion focuses on the psychological comfort the fires offered. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text’s second sentence mentions that fires were built in the summer because fog came in, which may have cooled the house, this detail isn’t the focus of the underlined portion. Instead, the underlined portion indicates that fires were built for reasons beyond physical warmth: to create a sense of being home and safe. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined portion focuses on the emotional significance the author places on having a fire going inside the home. There is no indication that the author feels equally comfortable without a fire present."

Obvious | B. Imaginable | C. Straightforward | D. Uninterrupted,B,"Choice B is the best answer because as used in the text, ""conceivable"" most nearly means capable of being thought of or imagined. The text describes a journey that, despite being ""insignificant in distance,"" was ""by no means an easy one"" because of the variety of obstacles that ""nature had determined to throw…in the way."" To emphasize the difficulty of the journey, the author portrays nature as actively scheming to present travelers with every obstacle that can be thought of—i.e., every imaginable obstacle. Choice A is incorrect because in this context, ""conceivable"" does not mean obvious, or evident. Instead, by referring to ""every conceivable obstacle,"" the text suggests a wide variety of challenges by evoking all the potential difficulties nature could present, not just those that the travelers might reasonably expect or foresee. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, ""conceivable"" does not mean straightforward, or easy to negotiate. The text is not indicating that the obstacles were simple to respond to and overcome. Rather, the text suggests that a wide range of obstacles made the journey difficult.

To urge people to protect the murals of San Francisco from decay | D. To describe the rise of mural painting in San Francisco beginning in the 1970s,B,"Choice B is the best answer because it best states the main purpose of the text. The text begins by briefly stating that San Francisco is known for its murals, then transitions to a discussion of a single collection of murals, which is found on Balmy Alley in the city’s Mission District. The text explains that the murals in this area were originally created in the 1970s, then observes that they have changed over time: as some have faded through the decades, others have been painted in their place. The text ends by emphasizing that these murals are significant because they reflect San Francisco’s artistic spirit and cultural life. Therefore, the text provides an overview of the history and importance of the Balmy Alley murals. Choice A is incorrect. Although it can be inferred from the text that there are murals in other areas of San Francisco besides Balmy Alley, the text doesn’t specifically discuss murals in other areas or compare the murals of Balmy Alley to those in other areas. Choice C is incorrect. By observing that some of the murals of Balmy Alley have been replaced due to fading, the text implies that murals can decay, but it never urges readers to protect this specific collection of murals—or any murals elsewhere in San Francisco, for that matter. Indeed, by describing the ever-changing murals of Balmy Alley as “a living showcase of San Francisco’s artistic spirit,” the text emphasizes the positive aspects of the fact that the original Balmy Alley murals have faded and been replaced with new murals. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t describe the rise of mural painting in San Francisco generally or note when this occurred. The only historical development of the 1970s mentioned in the text is the origin of the murals in a specific area of the city: Balmy Alley in the Mission District."

To warn a child that he will face many challenges throughout his life | D. To encourage a child to embrace the experiences life will offer,D,"Choice D is the best answer because it accurately states the text’s main purpose. The poem begins with the speaker urging a child to “go forth” with her encouragement (“my heart’s desire”). The speaker goes on to suggest that new experiences (“Great reaches, yet unknown”) lie ahead for the son that “life is calling” him to seek out. Thus, the main purpose is to encourage a child to embrace the experiences available to him in his life. Choice A is incorrect because the speaker encourages the child to pursue new experiences (“Great reaches”) without knowing exactly what those experiences will be (“yet unknown”) or suggesting that they should match the speaker’s own accomplishments. Choice B is incorrect because the speaker focuses on positive possibilities for her son (“Great reaches, yet unknown”) and her enthusiastic encouragement to embrace those possibilities (“life is calling you!”), while there is no mention of raising a child or associated struggles. Choice C is incorrect because the speaker frames the possibilities for her son in a positive light when she says that “great reaches, yet unknown” are waiting for him, and this positive outlook for the son is consistent throughout the text."

In this context, ""advantageous"" means beneficial or providing a favorable position. The text explains that being included in the book ""suggested that a business was an important part of the community,"" and it can be inferred that an enhanced reputation within the local community would benefit a business, commercially or otherwise. This context supports the idea that being featured in this publication would be advantageous. Choice A is incorrect because in this context, ""risky"" would suggest that being featured in The Illustrated History of San Mateo County might have negative consequences for a business. However, the text implies only positive outcomes since inclusion indicated importance within the local community. Choice B is incorrect because ""misleading"" would mean deceptive or deliberately giving a wrong impression, but the text doesn’t indicate there was something deceptive about being featured in The Illustrated History of San Mateo County ; rather, it suggests that inclusion indicated community importance. Choice D is incorrect because ""unremarkable"" would mean common or ordinary, which doesn’t make sense in context.

The text portrays Alice speaking about the snow falling against the window, describing it as sounding ""nice"" and similar to someone ""kissing the window."" These details most strongly suggest that Alice thinks the sound made by the snow falling against the window is gentle. Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts, ""gentle"" can mean sensitive, or caring about others’ feelings, that isn’t the meaning in this context; it doesn’t make sense to say that Alice thinks the sound of the snow cares about anything.

Late cranes with heavy wing, and lazy flight, Sail up the silence with the nearing night. And like a spirit, swathed in some soft veil, Steals twilight and its shadows o’er the swale.

It makes an extended comparison of nature to human emotions. | D. It identifies a location, then refers to a person living there.",B,"Choice B is the best answer because it best describes the overall structure of the text. The text first establishes the setting, a ""still lagoon,"" and then goes on to provide more details about the lagoon by presenting several descriptive images of nature, including a lizard that ""shrills his tune,"" ""oozing lichens,"" and ""thick, grey and humid"" vapors. Choice A is incorrect. Instead of simply naming species, the text presents descriptive images of nature; further, instead of naming animals and then moving on to name plants, the text refers first to a plant (""the wild rice""), then to two animals (""the lizard,"" ""the wild goose""), then to another plant (""rushes""), and so on. Choice C is incorrect because the text does not draw any comparison between nature and human emotions; it does not refer to human emotions at all. Choice D is incorrect. While the text does begin by identifying a specific location, a ""still lagoon,"" it makes no mention of a person living there."

British forces were burning nearby Danbury, Connecticut, and Ludington wanted to rally rebel troops to meet them. Although she was only 16 years old at the time, her brave feat made Ludington one of the heroes of the American Revolution. Since then, Ludington has been widely celebrated, inspiring postage stamps, statues, and even children’s TV series. Text 2 Historian Paula D. Hunt researched the life and legacy of Sybil Ludington but found no evidence for her famous ride. Although many articles and books have been written about Ludington, Hunt believes writers may have been inventing details about Ludington as they retold her story.

Sybil Ludington was crucial to the outcome of the Revolutionary War. | B. Historians have confirmed which route Sybil Ludington took. | C. Sybil Ludington was likely not a real person. | D. Many people have come to admire the story of Sybil Ludington’s ride.,D,"Choice D is the best answer. Both authors agree that Ludington’s story has been widely celebrated and revered by Americans, even if they disagree on its accuracy. Text 1 states that Ludington has inspired postage stamps, statues, and TV series, and Text 2 states that many articles and books have been written about her. Thus, both authors acknowledge the popularity of Ludington’s story. Choice A is incorrect. Neither author claims that Ludington had a significant impact on the war. Text 1 doesn’t mention how Ludington’s ride affected the war overall, and Text 2 suggests that Ludington’s ride may have been exaggerated or invented over time. Choice B is incorrect. Neither author claims that Ludington’s route has been verified by historians. Text 1 claims she rode 40 miles through Putnam County, but doesn’t cite any sources for this information, while Text 2 suggests the ride may not have even happened. Choice C is incorrect. This choice misreads text 2. Neither author claims that Ludington was not a real person, only that her ride may not have happened. Both authors seem to treat Ludington as a genuine historical figure."

The text describes a gathering of young artists and intellectuals. One person after another rose, and, as with an ill-balanced axe, attempted to hew out his conception of art a little more clearly, and sat down with the feeling that, for some reason which he could not grasp, his strokes had gone awry . As they sat down they turned almost invariably to the person sitting next them, and rectified and continued what they had just said in public.",Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portions in the text as a whole?,A. To demonstrate individuals’ puzzlement over the reputation of a certain artwork | B. To highlight the physical effort involved in individuals’ construction of large-scale works of art | C. To draw attention to individuals’ discontent with the group’s conversation about art | D. To emphasize the extent of individuals’ struggles to articulate thoughts on art,D,"Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately describes the function of the underlined portions in the text as a whole. The underlined portions describe the young artists and intellectuals at the gathering as trying to ""hew out,"" or give shape to, their views of art more clearly, but with each seeming to be using ""an ill-balanced axe"" and then feeling that the ""strokes had gone awry."" In context, the metaphorical language comparing attempts to refine concepts of art to imprecisely cutting wood with an inadequate axe serves to emphasize how much the individuals at the gathering struggled to articulate, or express, their thoughts; indeed, the text explains that the individuals couldn’t quite grasp why their statements had gone awry and tended to try to rectify, or correct, them in continued discussion after they sat down. Choice A is incorrect because the underlined portions characterize aspects of the young artists and intellectuals’ attempts to present their general views of art more clearly, not their views of the reputation of a certain artwork; the text never mentions any specific artwork or its reputation. Choice B is incorrect. Although the underlined portions refer to a physical activity—cutting wood with an axe—the descriptions are metaphorical rather than literal. The text isn’t describing people constructing works of art, large-scale or otherwise; rather, it’s describing people talking at a gathering, using the idea of imprecisely cutting wood with an inadequate axe to suggest that each individual struggled when trying to present their view of art more clearly. Choice C is incorrect. Although the underlined portions do provide a reason for the young artists and intellectuals’ discontent, the text focuses on the fact that they were each dissatisfied with their own statements, not on how they felt about the group’s full conversation about art. Instead, the text explains that each individual tried to present their view of art more clearly but struggled (as if imprecisely cutting wood with an inadequate axe), couldn’t grasp what went awry, and then felt the need to rectify, or correct, what they had just said. It’s possible that the individuals were also discontented with the group’s conversation overall, but neither the underlined portions nor the text as a whole suggest that."

In this context, “paucity of” means lack of. In describing the inspiration behind Al-Sweedan and Alhaj’s research, the text uses the word “though” to suggest a contrasting relationship between two types of studies: those examining the effect on blood chemistry of living at a high altitude and those examining the effect on blood chemistry of living in locations below sea level. This contrasting relationship and the text’s use of the word “many” provide context suggesting that there are few, if any, examples of the second type of study, whereas there are numerous examples of the first type. Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context for there to be a “quarrel about,” or open disagreement about, studies of the effect on blood chemistry of living in locations below sea level. The text’s use of the words “though” and “many” suggests a contrasting relationship in terms of amount between two types of studies: those examining the effect on blood chemistry of living at a high altitude and those examining the effect on blood chemistry of living in locations below sea level. There’s nothing in the text to suggest that the contrast between the two types of studies involves the extent to which researchers broadly agree or disagree about the contents of either type. Choice C is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context for there to be a “profusion of,” or great abundance of, studies of the effect on blood chemistry of living in locations below sea level. The text’s use of the words “though” and “many” suggests a contrasting relationship in terms of amount between two types of studies: those examining the effect on blood chemistry of living at a high altitude and those examining the effect on blood chemistry of living in locations below sea level. Rather than logically completing this contrast, “profusion of” would indicate that the two types of studies are similar in terms of amount, with many examples existing of both types.

The text begins with the claim that Joni Mitchell’s album covers use images she creates in order to emphasize ideas embedded in her albums. It then goes on to provide an example of how Mitchell’s self-portrait on the cover of Turbulent Indigo resembles a painting by Van Gogh, which the text indicates helps emphasize the strong connection Mitchell feels toward Van Gogh, a connection that is also expressed in the album’s title song. Choice B is incorrect because there are no references in the text to artists other than Joni Mitchell and Van Gogh. Choice C is incorrect because there is nothing in the text that calls attention to any similarities or differences between Joni Mitchell and Van Gogh. Instead, it mentions that Mitchell feels a strong “artistic connection” to Van Gogh.

To refute the idea that joy is a more commonly experienced emotion than sadness is | D. To demonstrate how the experiences of individuals relate to the experiences of their communities,A,"Choice A is the best answer because it accurately states the main purpose of the text. The text begins by discussing the promise of the future, with positive references to renewal such as “new roads,” “new beating of the drum,” and “fresh seeing.” But with the “new sun,” the text continues, there will still be “the same backs bending” and “the same sad feet” drumming, indicating that these difficulties will follow people into this new day. The poem thus considers both the rewards and challenges associated with the repetitiveness of human life. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t say anything about how memorable activities are, let alone compare the memorability of activities completed at different times of the day. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text contrasts hope with difficulty, it does not compare the relative frequency of joyful feelings with that of sad feelings.

In this context, “reciprocates” means responds in kind or degree. The text indicates that the relationship between certain fungi and trees in some habitats is “mutually beneficial” and involves a “symbiotic exchange” in which each organism helps the other access an important nutrient. In other words, each organism provides the same kind of benefit it receives: the tree provides a nutrient (carbon) for the fungus and the fungus reciprocates by helping the tree to absorb more of another nutrient (nitrogen). Choice A is incorrect because the text emphasizes that the relationship between certain fungi and trees in some habitats involves a “symbiotic exchange” in which each organism helps the other access an important nutrient. Nothing in the text suggests that the fungus “overreacts,” or responds too strongly, by allowing the tree to be better able to absorb a beneficial nutrient. Choice C is incorrect because “retaliates” means responds to a harmful action with a similarly harmful action. The text indicates that the relationship between certain fungi and trees in some habitats is “mutually beneficial” and involves a “symbiotic exchange” in which each organism helps the other, not that the relationship is one in which the organisms harm one another. Choice D is incorrect. In this context, “deviates” would mean departs from an established course or norm. The text explains that the relationship between certain fungi and trees in some habitats involves a “symbiotic exchange” in which each organism helps the other access an important nutrient. Because the relationship involves benefits for both the fungus and the tree, it wouldn’t make sense to say that the fungus deviates by helping the tree be better able to absorb a beneficial nutrient."

To ""popularize"" a technology is to allow it to be used and appreciated widely. The text explains that unlike the photos produced by earlier forms of photographic technology, carte de visite photos were inexpensive and could easily be obtained by ""everyday people,"" who enjoyed exchanging the images. Therefore, carte de visite photos helped popularize photography. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that instead of weakening the emerging technology of photography, carte de visite photos allowed it to be more widely accessed and enjoyed by people. Choice B is incorrect. The text establishes that large numbers of people enjoyed using carte de visite photos, so it can be inferred that these photos caused photography to be praised, or celebrated. However, it wouldn’t make sense to say that inanimate objects—in this case, photos—had praised photography; instead, carte de visite consumers themselves would have praised it.

The first sentence states that Tule geese typically take four days to migrate south. Then in the next sentence, which contains the underlined portion, the text describes the first part of that journey, which begins with the geese flying over the Gulf of Alaska while keeping about 100 miles from the Canadian shore. The rest of the text details the remainder of the geese’s typical journey and then mentions circumstances in 2020 that resulted in the geese taking an unusually long time to complete it. Thus, the underlined portion describes part of the Tule geese’s typical winter migration journey. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text concludes by stating that in 2020, Tule geese took twice as long to complete their typical migration, which suggests a change in their usual flight behavior, the underlined portion doesn’t discuss this. Instead, the underlined portion describes the first part of the Tule geese’s typical winter migration journey over the Gulf of Alaska. Choice B is incorrect. Although the sentence containing the underlined portion mentions that Tule geese breed in Alaska, the underlined portion doesn’t explain why the geese breed in that location. Rather, the text mentions Alaska to explain that it’s the starting point of the Tule geese’s typical winter migration. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined portion doesn’t discuss any other birds that migrate south for the winter. In fact, the text is only concerned with the migration of Tule geese."

Whatley. In this context, “hinder” means hold back or obstruct. The text explains that Whatley encouraged farms to allow customers on site to pick their own produce for a fee. He did so despite critics’ concerns that the customers would never pay to do so. This context establishes that the critics’ concerns didn’t hinder Whatley’s efforts to promote the practice. Choice A is incorrect. The text indicates that critics’ skepticism of the idea that customers would pay to pick their own produce didn’t have some effect on Whatley’s promotion of the practice. The text illustrates this assertion by describing Whatley’s “determined advocacy” for the practice. This context suggests that critics’ concerns didn’t obstruct Whatley’s efforts, not that critics’ concerns didn’t “enhance,” or increase or improve, Whatley’s efforts.

Choice A is incorrect because even though the underlined sentence states that Blood Orange and Moses Sumney were influenced by Keyboard Fantasies , it doesn’t say that all other musicians should also embrace the album’s experimental style. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text states that Keyboard Fantasies was not admired on its first release, the text doesn’t present any criticism of the album by younger musicians: it only presents two younger musicians who cite it as an influence. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined sentence doesn’t mention any differences between Keyboard Fantasies and the work of Blood Orange and Moses Sumney."

In this context, ""indulge"" means treat with excessive leniency. The text states that according to historian Edward Gibbon, Marcus Aurelius, who was widely considered virtuous, had only a single character flaw: his mild temperament. The text suggests that because of this flaw, Marcus Aurelius had an overly permissive nature. This context, in turn, supports the idea that Marcus Aurelius treated the vices, or evils, of those around him with excessive leniency, indulging rather than punishing those vices. Choice B is incorrect. While the text does state that Marcus Aurelius was widely considered virtuous, it gives no indication that he was inclined to ""despise,"" or hate, others’ vices. Rather, the text suggests that he showed undue tolerance for these vices because of his overly permissive nature—that is, his inclination to allow others to do as they wished. Choice C is incorrect because the text’s description of Marcus Aurelius as overly permissive suggests that he showed undue tolerance for others’ vices, not that he tried to ""moderate"" those vices, or lessen their intensity. Choice D is incorrect because the text’s description of Marcus Aurelius as overly permissive suggests that he showed undue tolerance for others’ vices, not that he attempted to ""criticize,"" or speak disapprovingly of, those vices."

In this context, ""imitation"" means something that resembles or reproduces something else. The text states that Forrest admired Faulkner’s style and that anyone familiar with Faulkner’s style would be able to see the stylistic similarities between a particular passage in Forrest’s novel Divine Days and Faulkner’s writing, a fact that supports the idea that Forrest’s novel pays tribute to Faulkner by reproducing, or imitating, Faulkner’s style. Choice A is incorrect because in this context, a ""forgetting"" would mean an instance in which something is overlooked or not remembered. The text emphasizes Forrest’s admiration for Faulkner’s style and the fact that Forrest’s writing in some instances closely resembles Faulkner’s stylistically. It therefore wouldn’t make sense to say that in trying to pay tribute to Faulkner’s style, Forrest failed to remember it. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, a ""rejection"" would mean a dismissal of something as unworthy. The text emphasizes Forrest’s admiration for Faulkner’s writing style, stating that parts of Forrest’s writings indicate efforts to copy that style. It wouldn’t make sense therefore to suggest that Forrest had rejected or dismissed Faulkner’s style as unworthy. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, an ""opinion"" would mean a view or judgment. Although the text focuses on Forrest’s admiration of Faulkner, which suggests that Forrest had formed a positive judgment of Faulkner’s style, the word opinion wouldn’t make sense in this sentence: the sentence doesn’t say that the passage from Forrest’s novel expresses his view of Faulkner’s style; rather, it suggests that stylistically, the passage closely resembles, or imitates, Faulkner’s writing."

As used in this context, “comparable to” would mean similar to. The text indicates that the relationship between the fossilized clavicle and shoulder bones of Little Foot and the clavicle and shoulder bones of “frequent climbers,” such as chimpanzees and gorillas, suggests that Little Foot had adapted to moving around in trees. This context suggests that the relationship between the fossilized bones of Little Foot and the bones of chimpanzees and gorillas is one of similarity—the Little Foot fossils are likely comparable to the modern ape bones. Choice A is incorrect because if the fossilized bones of Little Foot were “surpassed by,” or exceeded by or made inferior to, the bones of modern apes that are frequent climbers, it wouldn’t suggest, as the text says, that Little Foot was adapted to moving around in trees. If anything, learning that Little Foot’s clavicle and shoulder bones were surpassed by those of chimpanzees and gorillas would suggest that Little Foot was poorly adapted to climbing. Choice C is incorrect because if Little Foot’s fossilized clavicle and shoulder bones were “independent of,” or not influenced by or affiliated with, the bones of modern apes that climb often, it wouldn’t suggest, as the text says, that Little Foot was adapted to moving around in trees.

As used in this context, “rousing” means exciting or energizing. The text indicates that critics found the play to have “the opposite effect” on audiences of what the playwrights hoped for. The critics, the text says, thought the play was wearying rather than energizing to viewers. This context supports the idea that the playwrights hoped live performances of the play would be energizing, or rousing, to audiences. Choice A is incorrect because there’s no information in the text suggesting that the playwrights hoped live performances of the play would be “multifaceted,” or be varied or have many aspects. The text indicates that critics found the play to be wearying to audiences and that this was the opposite of what the playwrights hoped for. Multifaceted is not the opposite of wearying, but rousing is, which suggests that the playwrights hoped the play would be rousing.

The text says that critics found the play to be wearying to audiences and that this was the opposite of what the playwrights hoped for. Realistic is not the opposite of wearying, but rousing is, which suggests that the playwrights hoped the play would be rousing.

In this context, “saturated with” means thoroughly or completely supplied with. The text explains a problem encountered by some bicycle-sharing programs: users can return bicycles to different locations than where the users picked up the bicycles to start, which can result in a mismatch between bicycle supply (that is, where the bicycles are currently located) and user demand (that is, the locations where users are hoping to pick up bicycles). The text goes on to explain that Ikeguchi developed a way to identify when this mismatch is likely to occur. This context suggests that Ikeguchi’s method will show when it is likely that some locations have an insufficient supply and other locations, by implicit contrast, are saturated with bicycles. Choice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that some locations are “susceptible to,” or sensitive to or easily influenced by, bicycles. The text describes the phenomenon of bicycles being redistributed away from locations where users want them, not anything about those locations being influenced by the bicycles. Choice B is incorrect because the text describes situations in which some locations have an insufficient supply of bicycles because the bicycles have been relocated elsewhere, which suggests that the other locations have many bicycles, not that the other locations are “contingent on,” or dependent on, the bicycles. Nothing in the text suggests that the locations themselves depend on the bicycles for anything. Choice D is incorrect because it would not make sense in context to say that some locations are “depleted of,” or empty of, bicycles while others have an insufficient supply. The text describes situations in which bicycles have been relocated such that there is a mismatch between bicycle supply and user demand—the bicycles are no longer at the locations where users want to pick them up. This means that some locations do not have enough bicycles, while other locations must have many bicycles, not be depleted of bicycles."

Some scientists argue that volcanic activity was the true cause, as the K-Pg event occurred relatively early in a long period of eruption of the Deccan Traps range that initially produced huge amounts of climate-altering gases. These dissenters note that other mass extinctions have coincided with large volcanic eruptions, while only the K-Pg event lines up with an asteroid strike. Text 2 In a 2020 study, Pincelli Hull and her colleagues analyzed ocean core samples and modeled climate changes around the K-Pg event. The team concluded that Deccan Traps gases did affect global conditions prior to the event, but that the climate returned to normal well before the extinctions began—extinctions that instead closely align with the Chicxulub impact.","Based on the texts, how would Hull’s team (Text 2) most likely respond to the argument in the underlined portion of Text 1?",A.

By declaring that the changes in climate caused by the Deccan Traps eruption weren’t the main cause of the K-Pg event | C. By questioning why those scientists assume that the Chicxulub impact caused the Deccan Traps eruption | D. By asserting that the Deccan Traps eruption had a more significant effect on global conditions than those scientists claim,B,"Choice B is the best answer because it describes how Hull’s team would most likely respond to the argument in the underlined portion of Text 1, which asserts that volcanic activity in the Deccan Traps range led to changes in the climate and caused the K-Pg mass extinction event. According to Text 2, although Hull’s team found that activity in the Deccan Traps did indeed alter the climate before the K-Pg event, the team determined that the climate had returned to normal before mass extinctions began. This finding and the observation that the K-Pg extinctions closely align with the Chicxulub asteroid impact suggest that Hull’s team would likely dispute the claim in the underlined portion of Text 1 and say that the climate changes caused by the Deccan Traps activity were not the main cause of the extinctions. Choice A is incorrect because Text 2 describes how Hull’s team found that the climate had recovered from the changes brought about by the Deccan Traps activity before the K-Pg event occurred, which suggests that Hull’s team would disagree that the Deccan Traps activity caused the K-Pg event. Additionally, the claim in the underlined portion of Text 1 says nothing about how the Chicxulub impact changed the climate, so while Hull’s team might believe that the impact did in fact change the climate, they could not be said to agree with the claim in Text 1 on this point. Choice C is incorrect because there is no indication in either text that any scientists assume that the Chicxulub impact caused the Deccan Traps activity, so there is no reason to conclude that Hull’s team would question why the scientists referred to in Text 1 make such an assumption. Choice D is incorrect because Text 2 describes how Hull’s team found that the climate had recovered from the changes brought about by the Deccan Traps activity before the K-Pg event occurred, which suggests that Hull’s team would say that the Deccan Traps activity had a less enduring effect on global conditions than the scientists referenced in Text 1 believe, not that the effect on global conditions was more significant than those scientists claim."

According to the text, advertisers were reluctant to support television in its early days. The underlined phrase then indicates that this reluctance was partly due to the US’s involvement in World War II, which hindered television production. Thus, the underlined phrase identifies a specific reason behind some advertisers’ hesitance to support television. Choice A is incorrect. The text merely mentions that television was expected to be financed through advertising, as radio was at the time. Nothing in the text compares the origins of radio and television.

As used in this context, “intricate” would mean made up of complexly related elements. The text indicates that in the Three Sisters system, maize, squash, and beans form a “web of relations” in which the crops interact in various ways. The text’s description of these interactions—the bean vines growing on the maize stalks, the squash vines keeping weeds away, and the beans adding nutrients that the maize and squash use—provides context suggesting that this “web of relations” is intricate. Choice A is incorrect because describing the relationship among the crops in the Three Sisters system as “indecipherable,” or impossible to comprehend, would not make sense in context. Although the text presents the relationship as complex, the text’s description of the role that each crop plays makes it clear that the relationship is well understood, not indecipherable. Choice B is incorrect because the text discusses the practical benefits that each plant in the Three Sisters system provides to other members of the system, showing that the relationship among the crops that make up the system is not “ornamental,” or mainly serving a decorative purpose.

This moment marks a major cultural shift: a new way of representing and seeing the world had arrived with that train, and nothing would ever be the same. Text 2 The fact that there is no contemporary evidence that the first audience of Arrival of the Train was alarmed has not stopped the story from becoming canonical, even among film historians. But that phenomenon itself is highly revealing. Our belief that the coming of film was transformative is so strong that we invented and keep retelling a founding myth that divides cultural history into a (naïve) “before” and (sophisticated) “after.”","Based on the texts, the author of Text 2 would most likely agree with which statement about the description of the first showing of Arrival of the Train in Text 1?",A. It is more motivated by a perception of the significance of the invention of film than by facts. | B. It expresses a view about the transformative nature of film that film historians tend to regard as naïve. | C. It is not based on evidence and reflects film historians’ belief that they are more sophisticated than today’s audiences. | D. It reflects a misconception that is widely believed because it captures early film audiences’ sense that the new medium was alarming.,A,"Choice A is the best answer because it provides a statement about the description of the first showing of Arrival of the Train in Text 1 that, based on the texts, the author of Text 2 would most likely agree with. Text 1 indicates that members of the audience, unaccustomed to the new medium of film and believing that they were looking at a real oncoming train, allegedly reacted to the film with alarm. Text 1 then goes on to treat this anecdote as a factual account of the film’s first showing, interpreting it as a moment that marked a ""major cultural shift."" In contrast, the author of Text 2 indicates that though the story of the film’s first showing has become ""canonical,"" or widely accepted, there is no contemporary evidence to support the idea that the audience reacted as Text 1 describes. Text 2 goes on to explain that this factually questionable description likely persists because it functions as a ""founding myth"" that reinforces a widespread belief in the profoundly transformative nature of the invention of film. This indicates that the author of Text 2 would likely see the description in Text 1 as motivated primarily by cultural perceptions about film’s significance rather than by documented historical facts. Choice B is incorrect because the author of Text 2 doesn’t suggest that film historians regard the view about film’s transformative nature as naïve. On the contrary, Text 2 states that the story of the first showing of Arrival of the Train has become ""canonical, even among film historians,"" indicating that historians broadly accept this narrative as a compelling illustration of film’s impact, not that they regard either the narrative or the views it conveys about the transformative nature of film as naïve. Text 2 refers to a ""(naïve) ‘before’"" in cultural history, but this is describing how the myth itself characterizes pre-film audiences, not how historians regard views about the transformative nature of film. Choice C is incorrect. While the author of Text 2 does indicate that the story of the audience’s reaction to Arrival of the Train described in Text 1 is a myth that lacks evidence, the text doesn’t suggest that the story reflects the fact that film historians believe themselves to be more sophisticated than modern audiences are. Rather, Text 2 suggests that the story persists because of a collective cultural belief, which historians share, in the profound impact of the invention of film. Moreover, the ""naïve"" versus ""sophisticated"" distinction mentioned in Text 2 refers to how the myth characterizes audiences before and after the invention of film; it doesn’t characterize modern audiences versus film historians. Choice D is incorrect. Although the author of Text 2 would agree that the description of the first showing of Arrival of the Train in Text 1 reflects a misconception, the author wouldn’t agree that widespread belief in the misconception can be attributed to the fact that it accurately captures early audiences’ actual sense of alarm. In fact, the misconception identified by the author of Text 2 concerns the accuracy of the audience’s alleged reaction; the author questions whether early audiences were alarmed at all, stating there is ""no contemporary evidence"" that they reacted in this way. According to Text 2, the description is widely believed not because it accurately captures historical reactions but because it serves as a ""founding myth"" that supports a belief in film’s transformative cultural impact."

More than two years ago my parents bought a piano from some people who were moving to Utah. Mom and Dad gave it to my brothers and me for Christmas. I had to act really happy because it was such a big present, but I pretty much hated the thing from the second it was carried into the hallway upstairs, which is right next to my bedroom.

It explains why the narrator always wanted a piano close to her bedroom. | B. It establishes how the narrator feels about the piano. | C. It suggests that the narrator’s brothers are talented piano players. | D. It describes the event that led the narrator’s parents to buy a piano.,B,"Choice B is the best answer because it best states the main purpose of the text, which is to establish the narrator’s feelings about the piano. The narrator reveals that she “had to act really happy” about the piano even though she “pretty much hated the thing” as soon as it was placed upstairs near her bedroom. The narrator also describes the piano as glaring at her and compares it to a caged bird that wants to be set free. These details establish the narrator’s feelings about the piano, suggesting that it makes her uneasy. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that the narrator hated having the piano upstairs right next to her bedroom, not that she wanted a piano to be close to her bedroom. Choice C is incorrect because the only information provided in the text about the narrator’s brothers is that they were given the piano along with the narrator. Choice D is incorrect because the text does not describe the event that led the narrator’s parents to buy the piano from the people moving to Utah. Instead, the text focuses on the narrator’s feelings about the piano after it was given to her and her brothers."

In this context, “partnership” means collaboration or joint effort. The text states that Woolf’s sister Vanessa Bell was a talented painter and that Bell worked with Woolf to provide the cover art for most of Woolf’s novels. Thus, this context suggests that Woolf and Bell pursued a creative partnership in order to produce several of Woolf’s novels. Choice A is incorrect because there is no indication that Woolf or Bell were undergoing a “rebellion,” or revolt, against anything in particular. Instead, the text focuses on how they worked together in some aspects of the production of Woolf’s novels. Choice C is incorrect because there is nothing in the text to indicate that Woolf or Bell made a “discovery,” or encountered anything new for the first time as they worked together. The text suggests that Woolf had already written her novels and that Bell then assisted Woolf with the cover art for many of them. Choice D is incorrect because the text implies that Woolf and Bell had a positive relationship. According to the text, the sisters “worked closely” together to produce the cover art for many of Woolf’s novels; the text doesn’t mention whether while working together, Woolf and Bell had a “disagreement,” or conflict."

In this context, ""homogenous"" means uniform or highly similar. The text explains that the painters whose works are included in this museum’s collection employ an array of artistic styles, both Native and non-Native, traditional and new. Given this high degree of stylistic diversity, it is a misconception that Native art is uniform, or homogenous. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t consider whether Native art is controversial, or causes disagreement or discussion; instead, the text discusses the stylistic diversity of the collection of the National Museum of the American Indian. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text indicates that some of the artists whose work is represented in the collection of the National Museum of the American Indian blend various artistic traditions into highly individual styles of their own, this is not the primary focus of the text. Instead, the text is concerned with how Native art is often mistakenly perceived as uniform, when in fact it is stylistically diverse. Choice C is incorrect because the text never implies that people mistakenly conceive of Native art as theoretical, or concerned with philosophical or abstract issues; instead, the text’s discussion of Native art is framed around this art’s stylistic diversity versus the misconception of it as homogenous."

The absence of old friends one can endure with equanimity. But even a momentary separation from anyone to whom one has just been introduced is almost unbearable.,"As used in the text, what does the word “endure” most nearly mean?",A. Regret | B. Persist | C. Tolerate | D. Encourage,C,"Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text, “endure” most nearly means tolerate. In the text, Cecily and Algernon discuss parting, or saying goodbye. Cecily remarks on the deep pain of saying goodbye to people whom one has only known briefly and then comments on the equanimity, or calm steadiness, one experiences when separated from old friends. The text sets up an ironic contrast: one can easily tolerate, or put up with, the absence of close friends, but even a very short separation from a new acquaintance is unbearable. Choice A is incorrect. Nothing in the text suggests that Cecily associates regret, or a feeling of sorrow, with the absence of old friends. Rather, the text sets up an ironic contrast between the feeling of calm steadiness one feels when separated from old friends and the unbearable pain of being separated from new acquaintances. Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts “endure” can mean persist, or proceed stubbornly, it doesn’t have that meaning in this context because what is being endured is the absence of old friends. Whereas one can persist despite the absence of someone else, one can’t persist the absence itself. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t convey that Cecily encourages, or urges, old friends to be absent. Although it may be that Cecily prefers new acquaintances to friends she has known for a long time, the text focuses on her feelings as a result of others’ absences, not on her treatment of others."

The text presents something art scholars have noted and gives the example of people tending to find paintings with blues and greens more appealing than those with yellows and oranges. This context conveys that certain colors are more ""attractive to"" viewers than other colors are. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates only that people tend to find some colors more appealing than others and gives no indication that certain colors are ever ""confusing for,"" or puzzling to, viewers. Choice C is incorrect because the text discusses the relative appeal of certain colors in paintings but gives no indication that any colors would ever be ""corrected by"" viewers, or somehow fixed or improved by them.

In this context, “collected” means acquired and took away. The text indicates that although the boulders on the asteroid’s surface caused some unforeseen problems, OSIRIS-REx was able to gather a sample to return to Earth. This context suggests that OSIRIS-REx successfully collected a sample of 101955 Bennu. Choice A is incorrect because in this context “attached” means connected or affixed. The text indicates that OSIRIS-REx gathered pieces of 101955 Bennu to bring to Earth; it doesn’t suggest that the spacecraft attached anything to the asteroid. Choice C is incorrect because in this context “followed” means tracked or traveled behind and the text discusses OSIRIS-REx’s brief encounter with 101955 Bennu during which the spacecraft gathered a sample to bring to Earth.

Text 2 Bluegrass isn’t simply an extension of folk traditions into the era of recorded music. In reality, Bill Monroe created the bluegrass sound in the 1940s by combining Southern folk music with commercial genres that had arisen only a few decades before, such as jazz and the blues.

Researcher Kelly Bremner, however, has noted that Appia lacked technical expertise in the use of light in the theater. As a result of Appia’s inexperience, Bremner argues, Appia’s theory of light called for lighting practices that weren’t possible until after the advent of electricity around 1881. Text 2 Adolphe Appia was not an amateur in the practice of lighting. Instead, it is precisely his exposure to lighting techniques at the time that contributed to his theory on the importance of light. When working as an apprentice for a lighting specialist in his youth, Appia observed the use of portable lighting devices that could be operated by hand.

Theater practitioners who worked with Appia greatly admired his work. | D. Appia was unfamiliar with the use of music and sound in theater.,B,"Choice B is the best answer. The author of Text 2 directly contradicts Bremner’s claim that Appia lacked technical expertise by stating that Appia was “not an amateur in the practice of lighting.” His experience as a lighting specialist’s apprentice would have, the author of Text 2 argues, allowed Appia to “[develop] his understanding of what was possible” with the elements of theatrical design. Choice A is incorrect. Neither text describes how other lighting technicians responded to Appia’s ideas. Furthermore, this claim isn’t relevant to Bremner’s evaluation of Appia’s technical expertise. Choice C is incorrect. Neither text mentions anything about the opinions of theater practitioners who worked with Appia, so this answer choice does not relate to the claim about Appia’s level of technical expertise made by Bremner in Text 1.

As used in this context, “synchronization” means the act of things happening at the same time. The text indicates that the dodder and its host plant flower in unison and that this synchronization occurs because the dodder makes use of a protein produced by the host shortly before flowering. Choice B is incorrect because referring to “hibernation,” or the state of being dormant or inactive, wouldn’t make sense in context. The text focuses on something the dodder plant actively engages in—making use of a protein and producing flowers. Choice C is incorrect because stating that the dodder plant and its host engage together in “prediction,” or the act of declaring or indicating something in advance, wouldn’t make sense in context. Rather than indicating that the dodder plant and its host plant make a prediction about flowering activity, the text suggests that the host produces a protein as part of its regular flowering process and that the dodder then absorbs and uses that protein to flower at the same time. Choice D is incorrect because referring to “moderation,” or the act of causing something to become less intense or extreme, wouldn’t make sense in context. Although the text states that the dodder plant absorbs and uses a protein made by its host plant, it doesn’t suggest that the dodder lessens the host plant’s flowering activity; the two plants simply flower in unison."

Mrs. Wilkins and her friend Rose are traveling in Italy. “I’m going to have one of these gorgeous oranges,” said Mrs. Wilkins, staying where she was and reaching across to a black bowl piled with them. “Rose, how can you resist them. Look—have this one. Do have this beauty—” And she held out a big one.","As used in the text, what does the phrase “reaching across to” most nearly mean?",A. Joining with | B. Gaining on | C. Stretching toward | D. Arriving at,C,"Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text ""reaching across to"" most nearly means stretching toward. The text begins with Mrs. Wilkins stating that she wants to have one of the oranges that she’s admiring. The text then indicates that Mrs. Wilkins, staying where she is, holds out a big orange to her friend. This context suggests that when the text describes Mrs. Wilkins as reaching across to the bowl of oranges, it means that she is stretching toward the bowl. Choice A is incorrect because the text never suggests that Mrs. Wilkins is joining with, or becoming attached to, the bowl of oranges. Rather, the text indicates that she is stretching toward the bowl so she can pick out oranges for herself and her friend Rose to eat. Choice B is incorrect because the text never suggests that Mrs. Wilkins is gaining on, or overtaking in a competition or race, the bowl of oranges. The text suggests instead that the bowl is sitting still on a surface and that Mrs. Wilkins is extending her arm toward the bowl so she can pick out oranges for herself and her friend Rose to eat. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t indicate that Mrs. Wilkins is arriving at the bowl of oranges. In fact, the text states that Mrs. Wilkins stays where she is when reaching across to the bowl, meaning that she remains at a distance from it."

It provides an answer to the question in the previous sentence. | D. It notes that the question in the previous sentence has not been researched.,C,"Choice C is the best answer because it best describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The text begins with a question: have penguins always been unable to fly? The underlined sentence then presents an answer that has been offered by researchers, indicating that Theresa Cole and her team believe that penguins were once able to fly but lost that ability long ago as they began living in the sea. The text then describes the research that led to that answer. Thus, the function of the underlined sentence is to provide an answer to the question in the previous sentence. Choice A is incorrect because none of the terms used in the sentence that follows are defined in the underlined sentence; no definitions are given at all. Instead, the sentence presents Theresa Cole and her team’s answer to the earlier question about penguins’ ability to fly. Choice B is incorrect because there is no contradiction between the underlined sentence and the sentence that follows since both convey that at some point penguins underwent adaptations that limited their ability to fly and helped them swim and live in the sea. Instead of contradicting later information, the underlined sentence presents an answer to the earlier question about penguins’ ability to fly. Choice D is incorrect because the question in the previous sentence is about penguins’ ability to fly and the underlined sentence presents Theresa Cole and her team’s answer to that question based on their research into penguin flight, which is described in the rest of the text."

Bursts caused by neutron mergers typically last fewer than 2 seconds.",Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?,A. a coincidence | B. a reprieve | C. an incident | D. an oddity,D,"Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the duration of gamma ray burst GRB 230307A. In this context, ""an oddity"" is something that is odd or unusual. The text explains that the burst lasted for 200 seconds and that other bursts generated by neutron mergers have usually lasted fewer than 2 seconds. In other words, the duration of gamma ray burst GRB 230307A was unusual. Choice A is incorrect because the text focuses on a difference between the duration of gamma ray burst GRB 230307A and the typical duration of bursts caused by neutron mergers, not ""a coincidence,"" or a point of correspondence, between them; the text indicates that GRB 230307A lasted much longer than what is typical of other bursts. Choice B is incorrect. In this context, ""a reprieve"" would be either a temporary relief from something or a delay of a punishment, neither of which would make sense as something that the duration of a gamma ray burst could provide to the burst itself. Choice C is incorrect. Although it would make sense to refer to gamma ray burst GRB 230307A itself as ""an incident,"" or a thing that occurred, the missing word describes the duration of the burst, and it doesn’t make much sense to describe a length of time as an incident. Further, the sentence emphasizes that the burst’s duration was very unusual, not simply that the burst occurred."

In this context, “introduced” means brought into practice or use. The text states that the first reference to a seven-day week appears in the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh . The text presents this information about the seven-day week as an example of a concept introduced by the Sumerian civilization that persists into present-day civilizations. Choice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the Sumerian civilization “transformed,” or changed the nature of, concepts that persist into present-day civilizations. Instead, the text’s presentation of a Sumerian literary work that contains the first description of the seven-day week is an example of the phenomenon described in the first half of the sentence, suggesting that the Sumerians invented many concepts that still persist. Choice C is incorrect because the information that a Sumerian literary work includes the first description of the seven-day week suggests that Sumerian civilization may have originated the seven-day week and other concepts that persist into present-day civilizations, not that it “inherited” the concepts, or received them from an ancestral figure or culture. Choice D is incorrect because the information that Sumerian civilization produced the first description of the seven-day week is presented as an example of the phenomenon described in the first half of the sentence, suggesting that Sumerian civilization originated this and other concepts that still persist, not that the Sumerians “overlooked,” or failed to notice or consider, such concepts."

In this context “foundational” means the basis on which something else develops. The text indicates that Webster’s experiments in the 1960s and 1970s were earlier than, and “key” to, the work of later scientists in the field; thus, Webster’s work was foundational to the later scientists’ experiments and the eventual detection of a gravitational wave in 2015. Choice B is incorrect because the text does not suggest that Webster’s work was supplementary, or an additional element of an existing, larger project, but rather it was “the basis for” later experiments. Choice C is incorrect because the text does not assert that Webster’s work was repetitive, or involved doing something the same way many times. Rather, the text indicates that Webster’s work formed the basis for later investigations in the field of gravitational wave research.

To reveal the narrator’s recognition that she is hesitant to ask questions about certain aspects of a culture she is newly encountering | D. To emphasize the narrator’s wonder at discovering that the physical distance between two countries is greater than she had expected,A,"Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text. The narrator asserts that she loves both her “own” country (Japan) and her “adopted country” (the United States) even though the two countries differ “widely.” She also indicates that, at first, she would try to explain unfamiliar experiences that she had in the United States using the standards ingrained in her from growing up in Japan. Thus, the main purpose of the text is to convey the narrator’s experience of observing and making sense of the differences between two cultures she embraces. Choice B is incorrect because the text makes no reference to possible companions. Although the text does indicate that the narrator sometimes used the cultural framework she acquired growing up in Japan to explain some experiences she’s had, there is no suggestion that this was in service of making friends. And although “no one seemed to know” strongly implies that the narrator has interacted with other people in the United States, there is no indication that these conversations involved her discussing Japanese customs. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the narrator was hesitant to ask questions. In fact, the narrator indicates that “no one seemed to know the origin” of various customs, which provides evidence that, rather than being hesitant, she sought information from several people. Choice D is incorrect because the text makes no reference to the physical distance between Japan and the United States. Although the narrator indicates that the two countries differ “widely” and likens them to “two separate worlds,” these descriptions relate to cultural aspects of the countries and the narrator’s feelings about the two countries, not the physical distance between them."

In this context, ""superseded"" means surpassed or exceeded by something else. The text establishes that this plant has ""the largest known"" genome among eukaryotes and mentions ""the high biological costs of extremely large genomes,"" suggesting there are natural constraints that make it biologically disadvantageous to maintain such massive genetic material. This context supports the idea that it’s unlikely another organism will evolve an even larger genome that would replace this plant’s record—that is, its status as having the largest genome is unlikely to be superseded. Choice A is incorrect because in this context, ""protracted"" would mean drawn out over time or space, and the text focuses on the record size of the New Caledonian fork fern’s genome and the fact that extremely large genomes carry ""high biological costs."" This information suggests that the biological upper limit for genome size may have been reached and that the New Caledonian fork fern’s genome is therefore unlikely to be surpassed, or superseded, not that it’s unlikely to be protracted.

Choice A is incorrect. Although two authors are mentioned in the text, they both agree about the type of language that should be contained in books for young children. Choice B is incorrect. The text never discusses the evaluation of children’s literature. It does provide one view of how children’s books should be written, but never introduces a competing view. Choice C is incorrect.

In this context, “traditional” means conventional. The text states that rather than use “standard shapes and colors,” Fong pursued “innovative” and “daring” design choices in her work. Fong’s style is depicted as inventive, so it therefore makes sense in this context that she avoided mainstream, traditional designs in her buildings. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that Fong’s work is innovative and experimental. Thus, Fong’s design choices could reasonably be considered creative, or original. She likely would have pursued creative designs, not avoided them. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that Fong used “daring” hues in her designs. Thus, Fong likely would have pursued bold, or brave and vivid design choices; she wouldn’t have avoided them. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t address whether Fong’s designs are understandable, or reasonable or expected.

To question the belief that birds are intelligent | B. To compare tool use in humans with tool use in palm cockatoos | C. To establish that tool use doesn’t indicate intelligence | D. To argue that a variety of animals use tools,D,"Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately states the main purpose of the text. The text first states that animals make use of objects as tools to help them achieve different goals. The text then explains that although people used to think only primates use tools, tool use by dolphins (aquatic mammals) and palm cockatoos (birds) has shown that primates are not the only animals that use tools. Thus, the main purpose of the text is to argue that a variety of animals, not just primates, use tools. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t mention intelligence at all, focusing just on the idea that animals use tools. Further, the text mentions one kind of bird (palm cockatoos) only as an example of a non-primate that uses tools and describes its use of tools as creative, not unintelligent. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text mentions tool use in primates (a group that includes humans) and in palm cockatoos, it doesn’t compare humans’ tool use with palm cockatoos’ tool use. The text mentions palm cockatoos only as one example out of the variety of animals that use tools and never directly mentions tool use in humans.

In context, “It is by no means” followed by “unimportant” conveys how it is relevant to recognize Bosch’s influence on Banisadr. The text points out that the artist himself cites Bosch as an inspiration, and then goes on to claim that The Epic of Gilgamesh has had a more significant influence than Bosch. Choice A is incorrect because “substantial,” which means weighty or meaningful, incorrectly suggests that it wouldn’t be meaningful to acknowledge Bosch’s influence on Banisadr. The phrase “indeed, Banisadr himself cites Bosch as an inspiration” doesn’t support this suggestion.

In this context, a ""theory"" is an explanation that is considered scientifically acceptable. The text states that astronomers predicted in the 1990s that a collision between a black hole and a neutron star or between two neutron stars could release a massive gamma ray burst called a kilonova, explaining that they determined this possibility based on their extensive work with existing data and simulations (""calculations and models""). In other words, the prediction was a theory—a well-supported explanation—that, as the text indicates, was later confirmed with observations in 2017. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that it is the prediction made by astronomers in the 1990s that was confirmed in 2017, and a prediction of an event isn’t ""evidence,"" or proof, of that event’s existence, even when the prediction is based on extensive study. Further, there would be no need for later confirmation of something that was already recognized as evidence. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, a ""constant"" is a situation or factor that doesn’t change. The text indicates that it is the prediction made by astronomers in the 1990s that was confirmed in 2017, and there is no reason to describe the prediction as a constant because the text doesn’t suggest that the prediction was completely unchanged over time—it addresses only the making of the prediction and its later confirmation. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that it is the prediction made by astronomers in the 1990s that was confirmed in 2017; although a prediction might be informed by an ""experiment,"" or a controlled test, a prediction is an idea rather than a test."

The text states that the women used an axe to strike the maple trees in order to find out which ones would produce sap. The underlined sentence compares the trees to people, with the sap described as the trees’ “life-blood.” Some of the trees are ready to give out their sap, while others are unwilling to do so. Using personification, the sentence provides greater detail about the aspect of the maple trees—their potential to give sap—that the women are evaluating. Choice A is incorrect because the personalities of the women are not discussed in the text. Although the underlined sentence does mention “individual characters,” this reference is not to the women in the text but rather to the maple trees, which the sentence compares to people with individual character traits. Choice B is incorrect because the underlined sentence focuses on the trees’ willingness or refusal to yield sap, not on the beneficial relationship between the women and the trees. Additionally, although the text does suggest that the women and their tribe benefit from the maple trees since the trees allow the women to harvest syrup, there is nothing in the text to suggest that the trees benefit from this relationship in turn. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined sentence is comparing maple trees to humans, not addressing the influence of the natural environment on how the actual humans in the text, the women, behave."

The text establishes a comparison between two groups of mammals, stating that although they aren’t closely related, hedgehog tenrecs and true hedgehogs play similar roles in their habitats, a circumstance that has resulted in the independent development of some of the same physical traits. This context supports the idea that hedgehog tenrecs resemble, or share basic similarities with, true hedgehogs in some respects. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that hedgehog tenrecs are ""examples of,"" or representative of, true hedgehogs. The text states that despite some shared physical traits, the two groups of mammals aren’t closely related; therefore, hedgehog tenrecs can’t be examples of true hedgehogs. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, ""concerns about"" would mean worries about or interests in. The text focuses on the various physical traits that hedgehog tenrecs and true hedgehogs share. There’s nothing in the text to suggest why hedgehog tenrecs would be worried about true hedgehogs, or why they would be interested in them. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, ""indications of"" would mean evidence of. By listing a set of traits that hedgehog tenrecs share with true hedgehogs, the text establishes a comparison between the two groups of mammals, and saying that the traits shared within one group of mammals provide evidence of another group of mammals wouldn’t be an effective way to establish the similarities between the two groups."

As evidence, Siraj cited the carbonaceous chondritic composition of samples from the Chicxulub impact crater as well as of samples obtained from long-period comet Wild 2 in 2006. Text 2 Although long-period comets contain carbonaceous chondrites, asteroids are similarly rich in these materials. Furthermore, some asteroids are rich in iridium, as Natalia Artemieva points out, whereas long-period comets are not. Given the prevalence of iridium at the crater and, more broadly, in geological layers deposited worldwide following the impact, Artemieva argues that an asteroid is a more plausible candidate for the Chicxulub impactor.","Based on the texts, how would Artemieva likely respond to Siraj’s hypothesis, as presented in Text 1?",A. By insisting that it overestimates how representative Wild 2 is of long-period comets as a class | B. By arguing that it does not account for the amount of iridium found in geological layers dating to the Chicxulub impact | C. By praising it for connecting the composition of Chicxulub crater samples to the composition of certain asteroids | D. By concurring that carbonaceous chondrites are prevalent in soil samples from sites distant from the Chicxulub crater,B,"Choice B is the best answer. Siraj’s hypothesis is that the Chicxulub impactor was a long-period comet. But Artemieva points to the iridium found in the crater and in “geological layers that were deposited worldwide after the impact” as evidence that it was actually an asteroid, not a long-period comet. Choice A is incorrect. We can’t infer that this is how Artemieva would respond to Siraj’s hypothesis. Text 2 never discusses whether Wild 2 is representative of long-period comets in general. Rather, Text 2 presents Artemieva’s argument that the Chicxulub impactor was an asteroid, not a long-term comet. Choice C is incorrect. We can’t infer that this is how Artemieva would respond to Siraj’s hypothesis. Siraj’s hypothesis doesn’t make this connection: rather, Siraj hypothesizes that the Chicxulub impactor was a long-term comet. Choice D is incorrect. We can’t infer that this is how Artemieva would respond to Siraj’s hypothesis. “Soil samples from sites distant from the Chicxulub crater” is too vague. Only soil samples from sites that are connected to the impact in some way are involved in either hypothesis."

In this context, ""defunct"" means no longer existing or functioning. According to the text, many artworks that were produced in the mid-1990s to the early 2000s for exhibition on the internet have become inaccessible due to their reliance on certain software. As an example, the text cites Sinae Kim’s Genesis , which relied on software that was discontinued in 2021. This context supports the idea that the software is defunct. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that viewing artworks produced in the mid-1990s to the early 2000s for exhibition on the internet requires the use of software. Artists generally want their works to be seen by many people, so it wouldn’t make sense for creators of internet art to require the use of software that is ""arcane,"" or known or knowable to only a few people. Moreover, the text states that a prominent example of software used to view these artworks is Adobe Flash, which was discontinued in 2021, meaning it’s now defunct. Choice C is incorrect because ""ubiquitous"" would mean found everywhere, which wouldn’t make sense in this context. The text indicates that the reason why many artworks that were produced in the mid-1990s to the early 2000s for exhibition on the internet have become inaccessible has to do with the software required for viewing them. According to the text, one example of such software is Adobe Flash, which was discontinued in 2021, meaning it’s now defunct. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the software used to view artworks produced in the mid-1990s to the early 2000s for exhibition on the internet is ""extraneous,"" or irrelevant. Instead, the text indicates that use of specific software is required to view certain artworks from this period and that the discontinuation of the software renders the works inaccessible."

Many countries define urban settlements based on the number of people living in them. However, countries do not all use the same number; for example, Iceland uses a minimum population of 200, while the Netherlands uses 20,000. Other countries use a combination of population and other factors. This variation makes it difficult for researchers to compare aspects of urbanization in different countries. Text 2 Recently, a group of six international organizations developed global definitions of common types of settlements. The group developed a new measure called the “degree of urbanization.” This new measure establishes global criteria used to define three types of settlements (cities, towns, and rural areas) and allows researchers to better understand global urbanization rates.","Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the problem presented in Text 1?",A. By recommending that a specific institution should further investigate the problem | B. By suggesting that researchers focus on topics besides urbanization | C. By supplying additional ways in which urbanization research is difficult | D. By noting that a possible solution to the problem is available,D,"Choice D is the best answer because Text 2 presents a possible solution to the problem identified in Text 1—that is, how disparities in the criteria used by different countries to define urban settlements make it ""difficult for researchers to compare aspects of urbanization in different countries."" Text 2 describes the creation of a shared framework for studying global urbanization: ""global definitions of common types of settlements"" and a ""new measure called the ‘degree of urbanization’"" that ""allows researchers to better understand global urbanization rates."" Choice A is incorrect. Although Text 2 mentions ""a group of six international organizations"" that developed criteria and a measure related to settlements and urbanization, no organization or institution is singled out to perform further research. Choice B is incorrect because both texts are about urbanization research and neither mentions any other fields of study. Choice C is incorrect. Text 2 discusses a possible solution to the terminological problem in global urbanization research, not additional areas of difficulty in the field."

In this context, ""manifest in"" means evident or apparent from. The text states that the Kelmscott Press, which was cofounded by William Morris, produced its books using preindustrial methods. The text notes the similarity between those methods, which include the use of handmade materials and intricate ornamentation, and methods used in the creation of medieval manuscripts. This context suggests that Morris’s repudiation of industrialization is apparent from, or manifest in, the methods and materials his company employed. Choice A is incorrect because there is nothing in the text to suggest that Morris’s repudiation of industrialization is ""insensible to,"" or unaware of or lacking perception of, the use of handmade materials and intricate ornamentation in the production of the Kelmscott editions. Instead, the text suggests that the methods and materials used to produce the Kelmscott editions are evidence of Morris’s repudiation of industrialization. Choice C is incorrect because it would not make sense to say that Morris’s repudiation of industrialization was ""scrutinized by,"" or examined closely by, the Kelmscott editions’ use of handmade materials and intricate ornamentation. Although creating the Kelmscott editions may have involved examining the books closely, the text does not mention this aspect of Morris’s work, and in any case, the action of using certain materials to create those editions cannot scrutinize Morris’s attitude toward industrialization. Choice D is incorrect because the text gives no indication that Morris’s repudiation of industrialization is ""complicated by,"" or made more complex or difficult by, the Kelmscott Press’s use of preindustrial methods and handcrafted elements to produce books.

In this context, ""insurmountable"" means impossible to overcome or too difficult to solve. The text establishes that coming up with distinct names for minor planets is already a difficult task that has become even more challenging because there are now more than 500,000 known minor planets. The logical conclusion is that finding unique names for such a vast number of celestial objects has become virtually impossible—or insurmountable—which explains why the majority of recently discovered minor planets receive only identification numbers instead of proper names. Choice B is incorrect because ""feasible"" means possible to do or achieve, which would contradict the logic of the text. The text indicates that the task of naming minor planets has become more difficult because of their large number. The text then explains that this is why most new discoveries receive only identification numbers. If the task were feasible, there would be no reason to abandon the practice of giving proper names to minor planets in favor of using only numbers. Choice C is incorrect because ""substantial"" means considerable in size, amount, or importance. While the text does suggest that naming all minor planets would be a significant undertaking, describing the task as substantial wouldn’t logically explain why the naming practice has been largely abandoned in favor of using only identification numbers. The text suggests that the task has become virtually impossible (insurmountable), not merely large or significant. Choice D is incorrect because ""unnecessary,"" which means not needed, would suggest that giving proper names to minor planets serves no purpose. However, the text doesn’t question the value or purpose of naming minor planets; rather, it explains that the sheer number of discoveries has made the already challenging naming task nearly impossible to complete. The text provides an example of a named minor planet (1227 Geranium), indicating that naming has been considered worthwhile but has become impractical because of the volume."

Like many Impressionist painters, Degas used painted frames that stood in contrast to the gold frames frequently seen at the Paris Salon, a prestigious art exhibition that was sponsored by the French government and promoted traditional painting styles. Impressionist painters likely chose these colorful frames to distinguish themselves from what was considered conventional at the time. Text 2 Impressionist painters often focused on the interplay of color and light in their works. As such, those Impressionists who placed their works in painted frames instead of the more traditional gold ones did so for aesthetic reasons: a frame’s color was likely chosen because it would harmonize with the colors or subjects in a painting. Gold, conversely, could distract from the subtleties in a painted scene.","Based on the texts, both authors would most likely agree with which statement?",A. Gold frames were considered especially desirable by those who purchased works from Impressionist painters. | B. The colors in an Impressionist painting were often chosen to complement the colors of the frame it would be placed in. | C. Many Impressionist painters were intentional about the frames they selected for their works. | D. Degas’s preferred framing style was different from that of most Impressionist painters.,C,"Choice C is the best answer because it presents the statement about the use of painted frames in Impressionist painting that both authors would be most likely to agree with. Text 1 discusses painter Edgar Degas’s insistence that his works remain in their original painted frames, which contrasted with the gold frames that were typical of the Paris art scene at the time. The text then argues that the preference of Degas and other French Impressionist painters for colorful frames can likely be attributed to their desire ""to distinguish themselves from what was considered conventional at the time."" Text 2 also notes that Impressionist painters ""placed their works in painted frames"" but argues that they probably did so for a purely aesthetic reason: to ensure that ""the frame’s color...would harmonize with the colors or subjects in a painting."" Though differing on Impressionist painters’ rationale for using painted frames, the authors of both texts would agree that many Impressionist painters were intentional about the frames they selected for their works. Choice A is incorrect because neither text suggests that gold frames were considered desirable by those purchasing Impressionist works. Indeed, it can be inferred from the fact that Impressionist painters used painted frames that those who purchased those works wouldn’t have had a strong preference for gold frames. Choice B is incorrect because neither text suggests that Impressionist painters chose colors for their paintings based on planned frame colors. Indeed, Text 2 states that frame colors were chosen to ""harmonize with the colors or subjects in a painting,"" implying that the color scheme of paintings predated and took precedence over the choice of the colors of frames. Choice D is incorrect because Text 1 presents Degas’s preference for painted frames as being typical of Impressionist painters’ attitudes toward the framing of their works. Moreover, although Text 2 doesn’t specifically discuss Degas, it concurs with Text 1’s assertion that these painters preferred painted frames. Thus, both texts position painted frames as a hallmark of French Impressionist painting, not as a deviation from it."

This suggests that the paintings are displayed in a systematic, or organized, way. Choice B is incorrect. ""Ranked"" might mean either classified or placed in orderly rows. Neither of these meanings would necessarily imply that the names of the paintings are easy to see (even if the paintings are placed in rows, their labels might be obscured).

As used in this context, “prescribed” would mean laid down as rules. The text indicates that the characters in the comedies often defy gender roles that are “socially dictated” (even if most characters do return to those roles eventually) and that scholars have been very interested in these acts of defiance. This context indicates that what the characters are rebelling against are standards of behavior prescribed by the society of the time. Choice A is incorrect because saying that expectations about gender were “interjected,” or suddenly inserted between other things, wouldn’t make sense in context. There’s no suggestion in the text that the issue of gender roles was inserted between other things or was an interruption in a larger discussion.

In this context, ""opaque"" means difficult to understand or unclear. The text creates a contrast between the initial impression given by Hegel’s works and their influence and insight, noting that readers must ""penetrate Hegel’s frustratingly dense prose"" to access his important ideas. This context clearly establishes that Hegel’s writing is initially challenging to comprehend, or opaque. Choice A is incorrect because ""authoritative"" means influential or clearly accurate. Hegel’s works may be authoritative, but it wouldn’t make logical sense in context to say that although his works seem authoritative, they have been influential. Instead, the text focuses on the fact that Hegel’s works are challenging to read, but that working through the dense prose can be rewarding.

Moore’s careful work on common sense may seem obvious but was in fact groundbreaking. Text 2 External world skepticism is a philosophical stance supposing that we cannot be sure of the existence of anything outside our own minds. During a lecture, G.E. Moore once offered a proof refuting this stance by holding out his hands and saying, “Here is one hand, and here is another.” Many philosophers reflexively reject this proof (Annalisa Coliva called it “an obviously annoying failure”) but have found it a challenge to articulate exactly why the proof fails.","Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 1 most likely respond to proponents of the philosophical stance outlined in Text 2?","A.

By pointing out that Moore would assert that external world skepticism is at odds with other beliefs those proponents must unavoidably hold",D,"Choice D is the best answer. According to the author of Text 1, Moore’s definition of common sense—things we instinctively know are true—includes the belief that we all “exist in a world with other objects.” The author of Text 1 describes this notion as both “obvious” and “groundbreaking.” So it’s safe to infer that the author would observe that Moore would respond to external world skeptics by arguing that since everyone instinctively knows that things exist outside of their own minds, then external world skepticism must be wrong.

Although the underlined portion characterizes the waves as a relentless force (always “repulsed” but still “rushing on” and never being defeated), the speaker doesn’t suggest that the surroundings are intimidating. Instead, the speaker presents the scene in a positive way, describing the “deep delight” of the “gladsome,” or cheerful, waves and feeling “the heart / Leap joyous” while viewing the sea. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined portion doesn’t suggest that the speaker is ambivalent, or has mixed feelings about, the natural world. Instead, it presents a single view of one part of the immediate surroundings: the speaker characterizes the sea’s waves as an unstoppable force, since they are constantly pushed back but always return (“ever repulsed, yet ever rushing on”). Choice D is incorrect. Although the text later suggests the speaker’s view of her own thoughts by referring to a “clouded brain” and a heart that leaps joyously, this reference neither occurs within the underlined portion nor establishes a clear contrast with the relentless determination of the waves. The underlined portion addresses only the speaker’s view of the waves and doesn’t suggest what her own thoughts might be."

In this context, ""source"" means a place where something originates or is obtained. The text states that people would share news while socializing at the general store. This context supports the idea that the store served as a source of information in rural communities. Choice B is incorrect because ""rival"" would mean competitor or opponent. The text doesn’t indicate that the general store was a rival of anything. Instead, the text describes the general store as a place that enabled the sharing of information within rural communities. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, ""condition"" would mean state, circumstance, or requirement. Although the text implies that visiting the store was helpful for acquiring information since people shared news there, it wouldn’t make sense to say that the general store was a condition of information. Choice D is incorrect because ""waste"" would mean something that is unused, discarded, or spent unnecessarily, which would not make sense in context.

Given the many other echoes of Ellison in Morrison’s novels, both in structure and prose style, these scenes suggest Ellison’s direct influence on Morrison. Text 2 In their destabilizing effect on literary form, the sermons in Morrison’s works recall those in Ellison’s. Yet literature by Black Americans abounds in moments where interpolated speech erodes the division between oral and written forms that literature in English has traditionally observed. Morrison’s use of the sermon is attributable not only to the influence of Ellison but also to a community-wide strategy of resistance to externally imposed literary conventions.","Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely characterize the underlined claim in Text 1?","A. As failing to consider Ellison’s and Morrison’s equivalent uses of the sermon within the wider cultural context in which they wrote | B. As misunderstanding the function of sermons in novels by Black American writers other than Ellison and Morrison | C. As disregarding points of structural and stylistic divergence between the works of Ellison and those of Morrison | D. As being indebted to the tradition of resisting literary conventions that privilege written forms, such as novels, over sermons and other oral forms",A,"Choice A is the best answer. The author of Text 2 argues that Morrison’s use of the sermon is not only influenced by Ellison, but also by a “community-wide strategy of resistance” to literary conventions practiced by Black American authors. Ellison, Text 2 alleges, is only one of many influences on Morrison. Choice B is incorrect. Neither text specifically mentions sermons in works by authors other than Morrison or Ellison, only a tendency towards eroding “the division between oral and written forms” among Black American writers. Choice C is incorrect. Both texts describe similarities between the works of Ellison and Morrison, and neither points out instances of divergence. Text 2 simply suggests that Morrison was influenced by more than just Ellison. Choice D is incorrect. While Text 2 does discuss Morrison’s resistance to certain literary conventions, it’s unclear what it would mean for the underlined claim to be “indebted” to that tradition.

As used in this context, “featured” means had as a characteristic or part. The text indicates that although US traffic signals have lights of three different colors (red, yellow, and green), this wasn’t the case until the 1920s, when the three-light signal was first developed. Before then, the text suggests, traffic signals had fewer lights (as indicated by the word “only” in the second sentence). This context supports the idea that before the 1920s, traffic signals featured only red and green lights. Choice A is incorrect because “avoided” means kept away from someone or something or prevented something from occurring, neither of which would make sense in context. The text doesn’t discuss keeping away from someone or something but instead focuses on what US traffic signals look like. The text states that they didn’t have lights of three different colors until the three-light signal was developed in the 1920s. Choice C is incorrect because “appreciated” means admired or increased in value, neither of which would make sense in context. The text focuses solely on the fact that US traffic signals have contained lights of three colors only since the three-light signal was developed in the 1920s. The text doesn’t mention how this characteristic or traffic signals in general are perceived or what their value is. Moreover, the blank portion of the text describes “traffic signals,” which are lifeless objects and therefore unable to admire or increase the value of something. Choice D is incorrect because “disregarded” means ignored or treated something as unworthy of notice, neither of which would make sense in context. The text doesn’t discuss how people react to traffic signals; rather, it addresses the idea that US traffic signals have contained lights of three colors only since the three-light signal was developed in the 1920s. Moreover, the blank portion of the text describes “traffic signals,” which are lifeless objects and therefore unable to ignore or treat something in a particular manner."

To give an example of Julius’s knowledge about soil | C. To show that the narrator and Julius often hunt and fish together | D. To explain different ways in which Julius was helpful,D,"Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text, which is to explain different ways in which Julius was helpful. The text begins with the narrator stating that Julius was very helpful to him and his wife when they moved to their new residence. The narrator then provides a list of examples to illustrate Julius’s helpfulness. For instance, the narrator states that Julius was familiar with the neighborhood’s roads, which suggests that he was helpful in navigating them, and that Julius helped manage the horses and dogs. The text’s many examples of Julius’s usefulness reinforce just how helpful he was and in how many different ways. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t portray either the narrator’s or his wife’s reaction to their new home. Rather, the text focuses on how Julius was useful to the narrator and his wife in their new home. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text states that Julius was knowledgeable about the soil, this is one of several supporting details that illustrate how helpful Julius was. Moreover, the text merely states that Julius was knowledgeable about soil; it doesn’t provide an example of that knowledge. Choice C is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest the frequency with which the narrator and Julius hunted and fished together. In fact, it’s unclear from the text whether the narrator and Julius hunted and fished together at all. The text merely indicates that Julius knew the best places to hunt and fish—a detail that supports the text’s main purpose by conveying Julius’s usefulness."

It indicates Grande’s unhappiness over Mago’s disinterest in Grande’s doll. | B. It expresses Grande’s anger over Mago’s refusal to spend time with her. | C. It presents an example of how Mago and Grande generally played together as children. | D. It provides a reason for why Mago is unwilling to play with Grande.,A,"Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the function of the underlined portion in the text. The underlined portion (""which made me sad because that was the only thing Mago had envied me for"") directly expresses Grande’s unhappiness about her sister’s diminished interest in her Barbie doll. The underlined text specifically identifies that Grande feels sad and explains why Mago’s disinterest particularly affects her—because it was the one rare instance where her older sister had envied her, rather than the reverse. Choice B is incorrect because the underlined portion expresses sadness, not anger. Although there is some correspondence between the emotions anger and envy and the text does indicate that Grande usually envies her sister, the underlined portion states that Grande feels sad about Mago’s disinterest in Grande’s Barbie, not angry about Mago’s refusal to spend time with her. Choice C is incorrect. While the first part of the sentence that contains the underlined portion indicates that Mago has previously taken an interest in Grande’s Barbie, implying that the sisters may regularly have played with the Barbie together in the past, the underlined portion doesn’t provide an example of this. The underlined portion instead explains why Mago’s recently developed disinterest in the Barbie saddens Grande. Choice D is incorrect because neither the underlined portion nor the text as a whole explains why Mago is unwilling to play with Grande. Rather than addressing Mago’s motivation or reasoning, the underlined portion describes Grande’s emotional reaction to Mago’s disinterest in Grande’s Barbie and explains why this lack of interest matters to Grande."

Her other major novels consist mainly of scenes of everyday life and describe their characters’ interior states in great detail, whereas Orlando propels itself through a series of fantastical events and considers its characters’ psychology more superficially. Woolf herself sometimes regarded the novel as a minor work, even admitting once that she “began it as a joke.” Text 2 Like Woolf’s other great novels, Orlando portrays how people’s memories inform their experience of the present. Like those works, it examines how people navigate social interactions shaped by gender and social class. Though it is lighter in tone—more entertaining, even—this literary “joke” nonetheless engages seriously with the themes that motivated the four or five other novels by Woolf that have achieved the status of literary classics.","Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the assessment of Orlando presented in Text 1?",A. By conceding that Woolf’s talents were best suited to serious novels but asserting that the humor in Orlando is often effective | B.

By acknowledging that Orlando clearly differs from Woolf’s other major novels but insisting on its centrality to her body of work nonetheless | D. By concurring that the reputation of Orlando as a minor work has led readers to overlook this novel but maintaining that the reputation is unearned,C,"Choice C is the best answer because it reflects how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to the assessment of Orlando in Text 1. Both authors agree that Orlando is unusual for Woolf: Text 1 states that the novel examines its characters’ psychologies more superficially than Woolf’s other novels do, and Text 2 describes it as being lighter in tone. However, while Text 1 calls Orlando an “oddity” and mentions that Woolf “began it as a joke,” Text 2 asserts that Orlando engages the same themes as Woolf’s other great novels. Hence, the author of Text 2 would most likely accept that Orlando differs from Woolf’s other novels but would also insist on its importance in the context of Woolf’s work as a writer. Choice A is incorrect. Text 2 does suggest that the humor in Orlando is effective. However, there’s nothing in Text 2 to suggest that the author would agree that Woolf’s talents were best suited to serious novels. Rather, the author of Text 2 compares Orlando favorably to other novels by Woolf that are implied to be darker in tone. Choice B is incorrect because the author of Text 2 does not indicate that Orlando is less impressive than Woolf’s other novels, but instead points out that it engages the same themes as other novels by Woolf that are considered classics.

As used in this context, describing an explanation as “a straightforward” one would mean that the explanation is direct and uncomplicated. The text asserts that since it should be “nearly impossible” for planets to form in binary star systems, it’s “not surprising” that there isn’t a straightforward explanation for the existence of planets in such systems; the fact that one potential approach involves “complex” factors offers further contextual support for this idea. Choice A is incorrect because it would not make sense in context to say that there isn’t “a discernible” explanation—meaning an explanation capable of being perceived—for the existence of planets in binary star systems. The text discusses just such an explanation offered by Roman Rafikov and Kedron Silsbee, which indicates that their explanation can be discerned. Choice C is incorrect because the text emphasizes how difficult it is to explain the existence of planets in binary star systems, suggesting that the situation isn’t marked by the lack of “an inconclusive” explanation—an explanation that does not resolve the issue—but rather that if any explanations have been offered, they’ve likely been inconclusive ones. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that there is a lack of “an unbiased,” or impartial and unprejudiced, explanation for the existence of planets in binary star systems. The text indicates that it’s difficult to explain the existence of planets in such systems and it describes one attempt to do so, but there is no evidence that explanations from Roman Rafikov and Kedron Silsbee or others are biased."

In this context, ""consensus"" means agreement. The text indicates that a percentage given in a US forest land report differs from other estimates and that this discrepancy isn’t surprising, given that forest researchers regularly dispute one another’s classifications of parts of US forest land as either mature or old growth. This context conveys that there is little agreement when it comes to these categories. Choice A is incorrect because the text states that there is often dispute among forest researchers about classifications of US forest land as either mature or old growth, which directly indicates that when it comes to these categories, there is much ""deliberation,"" or discussion and consideration, not little deliberation. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that there is often dispute among forest researchers about classifications of US forest land as either mature or old growth; this doesn’t imply that there is little ""vigilance,"" or careful attention, among researchers when it comes to these categories but rather conveys that researchers do pay attention to forest land classifications and question one another’s decisions. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that there is often dispute among forest researchers about classifications of US forest land as either mature or old growth; this doesn’t imply that there is little ""interest,"" or concern, among researchers when it comes to these categories but rather conveys that researchers are concerned with forest land classifications and pay attention to one another’s classifications."

In this context, ""recognize"" means acknowledge or honor someone officially for their achievements. The text states that the fellowship was created for ""exceptional folk and traditional artists."" It then provides an example of one recipient of the fellowship, circus aerialist Dolly Jacobs, who was given the fellowship ""to celebrate her lifetime contributions to the arts."" The fact that the fellowship is given to celebrate exceptional artists for their achievements therefore suggests that its purpose is to publicly honor, or recognize, them. Choice A is incorrect because ""startle"" would mean alarm or surprise, and there’s nothing in the text to suggest that Jacobs and other artists who received the National Heritage Fellowship didn’t expect to receive it or were alarmed by it. It therefore wouldn’t make sense to say the fellowship was created to publicly alarm or surprise exceptional artists. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, ""familiarize"" would mean make known or familiar, but the text gives no indication that Jacobs or other recipients of the National Heritage Fellowship were unknown or unfamiliar before receiving the fellowship or that the fellowship was intended to make them familiar to the public. In fact, the text describes recipients as ""exceptional"" and notes that Jacobs received the award ""to celebrate her lifetime contributions to the arts,"" both of which suggest that Jacobs and other recipients were already well known in the arts world. Choice D is incorrect because ""convey"" would mean either transport or communicate something, neither of which would be logical in this context. The fellowship doesn’t transport artists, and though the process of awarding the fellowship might communicate something about the artists to the general public, it would be illogical to state that the fellowship communicates the artists themselves. Rather, the fellowship honors artists for their contributions."

This context conveys that the critics found the piece particularly creative. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that critics praised the installation for being dynamic and including huge images and lots of sound, and it wouldn’t make sense to describe such an exhibit as “restrained,” or limited and not extravagant or showy. Choice C is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that critics found the installation “inexplicable,” or incapable of being explained or interpreted, since the critics were able to explain their praise for the installation’s transformation of a space with huge images and lots of sound.

The text first identifies a shortcoming in the research: a ""myopic focus on a few countries"" despite claims of ""global relevance."" The text then explains that researchers later gained access to new data from previously excluded regions (Africa and Eastern Europe). This context supports the idea that with these new data, researchers would be able to reduce, or mitigate, the identified shortcoming by incorporating a broader range of geographic regions into their studies of income inequality.

It is unfairly dismissive given the progress that Srivastava and her team have reported.,B,"Choice B is the best answer because it reflects how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to Text 1 based on the information provided. Text 1 discusses the discovery of a regeneration-linked gene, EGR, in both three-banded panther worms (which are capable of full regeneration) and humans (who have relatively limited regeneration abilities). Text 1 characterizes this discovery as “especially promising” and a sign of “exciting progress” in understanding human regeneration. The author of Text 2, on the other hand, focuses on the fact that the team that reported the EGR finding pointed out that while EGR’s function in humans isn’t yet known, it’s likely very different from its function in panther worms. Therefore, the author of Text 2 would most likely say that Text 1’s enthusiasm about the EGR discovery is overly optimistic given Srivastava’s team’s observations about EGR in humans. Choice A is incorrect because the author of Text 2 explains that Srivastava and her team explicitly reported that they haven’t yet identified how EGR functions in humans; therefore, the author of Text 2 wouldn’t say that Text 1’s excitement is reasonable for the stated reason. Instead, the author of Text 2 would likely characterize Text 1’s excitement as premature and overly optimistic. Choice C is incorrect because Text 1 does treat Srivastava’s team’s findings with enthusiasm; it describes the discovery of EGR in both three-banded panther worms and humans as promising and exciting. It would be illogical for the author of Text 2 to say that because most others treat the discovery with enthusiasm, Text 1’s enthusiastic characterization of the discovery is unexpected. Choice D is incorrect because Text 1 isn’t at all dismissive of Srivastava’s team’s findings; instead, Text 1 is optimistic about the EGR discovery, characterizing it as promising and exciting. There’s nothing in Text 2 to suggest that the author of Text 2 would say that Text 1’s praise for the discovery is dismissive, or disdainful."

It identifies a conflict between research findings and recent events that the text goes on to suggest is a consequence of a complicating factor in the data used to generate those findings. | C. It presents a long-standing divergence in research findings that the text goes on to say is due to different groups of researchers using data that derive from different electoral circumstances. | D. It describes a recent exception to a general pattern in research findings that the text goes on to explain is a result of researchers underestimating the significance of inconsistencies in the data they’ve analyzed.,B,"Choice B is the best answer because it best describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The underlined sentence explains that contrary to what several studies would suggest, recent European governments suffered electorally after the launch of fiscal austerity programs. The text goes on to indicate that the researchers generated their findings from data that didn’t reveal the true political risk of austerity measures because the data were based on cases in which governments had set austerity programs to take effect after the next election, a practice the European governments that recently suffered electorally didn’t adhere to, thus introducing a complicating factor resulting in a conflict between the research findings and recent events. Choice A is incorrect because the underlined sentence doesn’t indicate that the discrepancy described in the text is between observations made in study settings and observations made in real-world settings. Rather, the underlined sentence indicates that the outcome of recent events is contrary to what would be expected based on the findings of several studies. Additionally, there is nothing in the text to suggest that the studies mentioned did not use real-world data; instead, the text indicates that the data used was generated under potentially different circumstances than the recent events. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined sentence doesn’t present a long-standing divergence in research findings but rather a discrepancy between past research findings and recent events that the text goes on to attribute to researchers’ use of data that didn’t reveal the true political risk of austerity measures. Choice D is incorrect because while the underlined sentence notes that there have been some recent exceptions to a general pattern observed in several research studies, it does not go on to attribute this exception to the researchers underestimating inconsistencies in the data. Rather, the text goes on to attribute this to a circumstance (fiscal austerity measures being implemented before an election rather than after) which adds a complicating factor into the data not accounted for in past studies."

The text begins by stating that there were many Spanish-language newspapers in cities across Texas in the late 1800s, citing San Antonio as a city that produced eleven such newspapers. The text then goes on to note that in El Paso, there were twenty-two newspapers published in Spanish in the late 1800s, more than any other Texas city. The text then concludes by explaining that the reason for this large number of Spanish-language newspapers was likely El Paso’s location near Mexico and its large population of Spanish speakers. Therefore, the main purpose of the text is to explain that Spanish-language newspapers thrived in Texas cities, especially in El Paso, in the late 1800s. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t discuss Spanish-language newspapers published in Texas today, let alone compare them with newspapers that were published in the 1800s. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text characterizes El Paso as a particularly rich site for Spanish-language journalism in the late 1800s, the text doesn’t discuss whether newspapers published in El Paso influenced the newspapers published in other cities across Texas, including San Antonio.

Although many scholars had assumed that the symbols signified entire words, linguist Alfonso Lacadena theorized in 2008 that they signified units of language smaller than words: individual syllables. Text 2 The growing consensus among scholars of Nahuatl script is that many of its symbols could signify either words or syllables, depending on syntax and content at any given site within a text. For example, the symbol signifying the word huipil (blouse) in some contexts could signify the syllable “pil” in others, as in the place name “Chipiltepec.” Thus, for the Aztecs, reading required a determination of how such symbols functioned each time they appeared in a text.","Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely characterize Lacadena’s theory, as described in Text 1?",A. By praising the theory for recognizing that the script’s symbols could represent entire words | B. By arguing that the theory is overly influenced by the work of earlier scholars | C. By approving of the theory’s emphasis on how the script changed over time | D. By cautioning that the theory overlooks certain important aspects of how the script functioned,D,"Choice D is the best answer. Lacadena’s theory is that Nahuatl script symbols signified syllables, but the consensus described in Text 2 is that they can signify either symbols or full words, depending on the context. So the author of Text 2 would likely consider Lacadena’s theory too simplistic: it’s missing the importance of the context in determining the meaning of a symbol. Choice A is incorrect. This conflicts with Text 1’s description of Lacadena’s theory. Lacadena’s theory is that Nahuatl script symbols signified syllables. Choice B is incorrect. This conflicts with Text 1’s description of Lacadena’s theory. Text 1 states that Lacadena’s theory differed from what earlier scholars believed. Choice C is incorrect. We can’t infer that this is how the author of Text 2 would characterize Lacadena’s theory. Neither text mentions how or even if the script changed over time."

The text begins by noting that researchers have long believed that woolly mammoths were hunted to extinction in North America by humans using spears with Clovis points. The text then describes an experiment conducted by an anthropologist to test this hypothesis. According to the text, the results of the experiment led the anthropologist to conclude that hunters using spears with Clovis points likely weren’t the primary cause of the extinction. The anthropologist’s results cast doubt on the long-held hypothesis presented at the beginning of the text and suggest that woolly mammoths may have become extinct in North America due to some other cause. Choice A is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that researchers have been involved in an ongoing debate. On the contrary, the text suggests that most researchers agree on the cause of the woolly mammoth’s extinction in North America. Choice B is incorrect because the text never mentions any advantages or disadvantages of the method used in the experiment, focusing instead on the results achieved using that method. Choice C is incorrect because the text addresses only one hypothesis, that mammoths were hunted to extinction in North America by humans using spears with Clovis points.

It notes an obstacle to observing an astronomical phenomenon, mentions a navigational ability of certain animals that inspired a solution to that obstacle, and then explains how researchers used an optical device to mimic that ability.",D,"Choice D is the best answer because it accurately describes the overall structure of the text. The text begins by pointing out an obstacle to observing the astronomical phenomenon of the NCP: the NCP is visible only at night. The text then indicates that, inspired by the ability of some insects and birds to navigate using visualizations of polarized sunlight, researchers devised a way to locate the NCP during daylight. The text then indicates that the researchers mimicked the insects’ and birds’ polarized-light visualization capabilities using a polarimetric camera. Thus, the text notes an obstacle to observing an astronomical phenomenon, mentions a navigational ability of certain animals that inspired a solution to that obstacle, and then explains how researchers used an optical device to mimic that ability. Choice A is incorrect. Although it’s reasonable to conjecture that humans have used the NCP for navigation, the text doesn’t indicate this is the case, let alone that the NCP is relevant to a majority of navigational tools. Furthermore, the text doesn’t state that researchers discovered that insects and birds navigate without the NCP; rather, it indicates that it’s known that some animals navigate by using skylight polarization to locate the NCP during the day and that this knowledge inspired the method the researchers devised. Choice B is incorrect. Although it’s reasonable to conjecture that humans have used the NCP for navigation, the text doesn’t state that this is the case. Furthermore, the text discusses how some animals’ use of navigational strategies based on the same celestial occurrence served as the inspiration for the researchers’ polarized-light approach, not as the basis for a comparison of the relative effectiveness of animal and human methods of navigation. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text implies that humans have typically been able to locate the NCP visually at night and indicates that some animals use the NCP to navigate, the text doesn’t state that humans use the NCP for navigation. The text therefore doesn’t emphasize a difference between how humans and animals use the NCP for this purpose.

The text then refutes ""solar energy–driven ice vaporization"" and ""the singular nature of impact ejection"" as two possible explanations for Asteroid 6478 Gault’s intermittent mass loss. Finally, the text presents Luu et al.’s explanation that ""6478 Gault is shedding mass due to rotational instability,"" which the author says is ""likely correct."" Thus, the overall structure of the text is that it introduces a natural phenomenon, refutes two potential explanations for that phenomenon, and then presents a third explanation for that phenomenon that the author regards as plausible.

Text 1 indicates that Fan found that a newspaper merger would result in a rise in subscription prices. This rise wouldn’t benefit customers, who would have to pay more for news after a merger. Text 2 presents Focarelli and Panetta’s argument that merger research tends to focus too much on what happens immediately after the merger. Text 2 goes on to describe their finding that mergers can be economically beneficial for consumers over the long term. This suggests that Focarelli and Panetta would encourage Fan to investigate the long-term effect of the hypothetical newspaper merger on subscription prices. Choice A is incorrect because Text 2 doesn’t indicate that Focarelli and Panetta connect the effects of mergers to specific locations. Instead, Focarelli and Panetta focus on the length of time over which the effects of mergers should be evaluated. Choice B is incorrect because Text 2 indicates that Focarelli and Panetta found that merged companies experience ""efficiency gains"" over the long term, meaning that their expenses go down relative to their output, not that their expenses increase. Choice D is incorrect because there’s no indication in Text 2 that Focarelli and Panetta believe that the newspaper industry is different from any other industry when it comes to the effects of mergers. Although their own research was about consumer banking, Text 2 suggests that they view their conclusions as applicable to mergers in general."

It emphasizes a disagreement between Tharp and Heezen. | D. It presents data to support a claim that Tharp and Heezen made.,A,"Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The first sentence of the text establishes that scientists didn’t know much about the ocean floor in the 1950s. The second sentence, which is underlined, describes what many scientists thought at the time—that the ocean floor was mostly flat. The remainder of the text establishes that the ocean floor is far from flat, citing research conducted by Marie Tharp and Bruce Heezen. Thus, the purpose of the underlined sentence is to identify a scientific belief that Tharp and Heezen showed to be wrong. Choice B is incorrect. Although Tharp and Heezen’s work with sonar data in the Atlantic Ocean is mentioned later in the text, the underlined sentence doesn’t describe the design of their experiment. Instead, it identifies a belief held by scientists that Tharp and Heezen demonstrated to be wrong. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined sentence presents a belief held by many scientists in the 1950s; nowhere does the text mention a disagreement between Tharp and Heezen, whom the text describes as research partners working together to map the ocean floor. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined sentence doesn’t present data in support of a claim; instead, it presents a scientific belief that Tharp and Heezen’s work showed to be wrong."

It presents a conclusion about Roman trade routes based on the team’s findings. | B. It questions how the team was able to conclude that the planks were used to build a boat. | C. It explains why the planks were made from oak rather than a different kind of wood. | D. It describes common methods used in Roman subway construction.,A,"Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The first sentence explains that Bernabei and his team studied growth rings to obtain information about the ancient oak planks found during a construction project in Rome. The next sentence presents what the researchers learned: the wood from the planks came from France’s Jura region, which is far from Rome. The underlined sentence then presents the implications of the findings about the planks: the wood must have been brought to Rome by boat, a difficult task that suggests Roman trade routes were complex. Thus, the underlined sentence mainly functions to present a conclusion about Roman trade routes based on the team’s findings. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that the team thought the ancient planks were used in the construction of a boat, nor does the underlined sentence question that conclusion. Instead, the text states that the wood could only have been transported from Jura to Rome in a boat. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined sentence simply offers a conclusion drawn from the team’s findings about the likely place of origin of the ancient planks; the text never mentions why oak was chosen for the planks instead of other wood. Choice D is incorrect because neither the underlined sentence nor the text as a whole addresses any methods that Romans used in constructing subways. Instead, the underlined sentence offers a conclusion drawn from the team’s findings about the likely place of origin of the ancient wooden planks discovered."

It is best, however, to understand Soyinka’s body of work as a dramatist chronologically. Soyinka’s progression as a playwright can be considered to fall into three periods, with each one representing a particular thematic and stylistic cohesion: the 1960s, the two decades between 1970 and 1990, and lastly, from roughly 1990 onwards. Text 2 It is tempting to impose a linear sense of order on the expanse of Wole Soyinka’s body of work as a dramatist. However, critics who have considered Soyinka’s plays to fit neatly into three phases overlook potential commonalities in Soyinka’s work that span across these phases. Additionally, this view may discount significant differences in the styles and content of plays written around the same time.",Which choice best describes a difference in how the author of Text 1 and the author of Text 2 view the study of Soyinka’s works of drama?,"A. While the author of Text 1 believes that thinking about Soyinka’s works of theater in phases is useful, the author of Text 2 views such an approach as limiting. | B.

The author of Text 1 considers Soyinka’s plays to showcase his strongest writing, whereas the author of Text 2 believes that Soyinka’s poetry is where he is most skilled. | D. The author of Text 1 argues that Soyinka’s early plays were his most politically charged, whereas the author of Text 2 claims that Soyinka’s most recent plays are the most politicized.",A,"Choice A is the best answer. The author of Text 1 states that Soyinka’s progression as a playwright can be considered to fall into three periods, implying that this is a helpful way to understand his works. The author of Text 2, on the other hand, challenges this view and says that it overlooks potential commonalities and differences in Soyinka’s work across what Text 1 calls distinctive stylistic phases. Choice B is incorrect. This choice overstates the central claim of Text 2. The author of Text 2 argues against the chronological progression supported in Text 1, but does not go so far as to say that Soyinka’s style remained consistent. In fact, Text 2 points out “significant differences in styles and content” among Soyinka’s plays. Choice C is incorrect. Neither of the texts mention Soyinka’s poetry, nor do they rank his dramatic writing relative to his other work. Choice D is incorrect. Neither text discusses the political aspects of Soyinka’s plays, nor do they make any claims about whether they have changed over time."

In this context, ""reforms"" most nearly means attempts at improving something. The text indicates that the pay-upon-delivery postage method led to fee avoidance on the part of recipients. It then says that action was taken to improve the postal system, giving examples such as the move to having the sender pay and affixing stamps to indicate payment had been received. These represent revisions to the system intended to improve its functioning; therefore, ""reforms"" most logically completes the text. Choice A is incorrect. In this context, ""investigations"" most nearly means attempts to understand something. And although it is plausible that an attempt to improve the postal system would involve investigations, nothing in the text provides a logical basis for understanding the example of changes like affixing stamps to letters as an investigation. Choice B is incorrect. In this context, ""expansions"" most nearly means additions to something. Although the text indicates that some new policies were adopted, nothing in the text suggests that the overall number of policies increased, which expansions would seem to entail.

In this context, “foster” means encourage or promote the development of. The text indicates that Jung and her team found that seeing a helpful (or prosocial) act makes a bystander more likely to help someone else, which can in turn inspire additional people to help others. That is, the team showed that single acts of kindness can foster additional prosocial acts across a group. Choice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Jung and her team found that single acts of kindness “require,” or depend on or make obligatory, broader prosocial (or helpful) behavior across a group. There’s no suggestion in the text that individual acts of kindness can only occur if other prosocial acts have already occurred, and the text indicates only that an act of kindness can inspire additional helpful acts, not that it necessarily will do so. Choice B is incorrect because the text focuses on a possible direct effect of individual acts of kindness, or single helpful actions, and it wouldn’t make sense to suggest that actions can “remember,” or hold a memory of, something.

To elaborate on the idea that the people around Tom lack the skills to successfully stage a play | D. To assert that Tom believes the group performing the play will be able to successfully promote it,A,"Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately portrays the main purpose of the text. At the beginning of the text, Tom asserts that he and the other people staging the play are doing so only for “a little amusement among ourselves” and aren’t interested in attracting an audience or any attention with the production. Then, Tom promises that the play they chose is modest and appropriate, and he further reasons that using the well-written prose of “some respectable author” is better than using their own words. Overall, the main purpose of the text is to convey Tom’s promise that the play will be inoffensive and involve only a few people.

Instead, the text focuses on how harmless the entire endeavor will be. Choice C is incorrect. Although Tom mentions that using the words of a “respectable author” will be better than using their own words, he never addresses the idea that the people around him generally aren’t skilled enough to stage a play.

As used in this context, “recognizable” means apparent or identifiable. The text indicates that handedness is “easy to observe in humans,” but that animal-behavior researchers use special tasks to determine handedness in other animals. This context and the use of “less” before the blank indicate that compared with handedness in humans, handedness in other animals is less recognizable. Choice B is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that handedness is less “intriguing,” or fascinating, in nonhuman animals than it is in humans.

The narrator says that ""there ain’t nothing funnier"" than watching people try to work out on the stair climber machine. Thus, the main purpose of the text is to describe an activity that the narrator finds amusing. Choice A is incorrect because the text isn’t about the narrator beginning middle school. The text describes how the narrator finds people working out at a gym amusing and makes no mention of school life.

In this context, “observant” means watchful and perceptive. The text emphasizes that the “close attention” Lawrence paid to “all the details” of his neighborhood allowed him to reflect subtle elements of “the beauty and vitality of the Black experience” in his artwork. This context indicates that being observant of his surroundings was an important part of Lawrence’s work as an artist. Choice A is incorrect because the text gives no indication that Lawrence was “skeptical,” or had an attitude of doubt in general or about particular things, let alone that skepticism was important to him as an artist.

In this context, “involuntarily” means done without any control, or by reflex. The text explains that when a person’s diaphragm repeatedly contracts and results in hiccups (which may be beneficial for infants), those muscle contractions are “uncontrollable.” This context indicates that the diaphragm contractions occur without the person’s control. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t support the logical relationship established in the text’s discussion of diaphragm contractions and hiccups. The text indicates that although specific causes for hiccups haven’t been identified, it may be the case that the muscle contractions that occur have an important purpose in infants. It wouldn’t make sense to say that even though the contractions occur “beneficially,” or with a good or helpful effect, they might play a positive role in infants’ breathing regulation. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that the diaphragm contractions that result in hiccups are “uncontrollable.” Because those muscle contractions are described as happening automatically and without the person’s control, it wouldn’t make sense to describe them as occurring “strenuously,” or in a way that requires great effort or energy.

The first two sentences introduce the idea that soil and rocks can be moved from one location to another by something other than rivers and streams. The underlined sentence then states that the term used by scientists to refer to this process is “aeolian transport.” The discussion that follows explains what aeolian transport is (the movement of small geological materials over potentially great distances by the wind) and describes an example of a study that found that dust particles had been moved by aeolian transport from Australia to Antarctica. Thus, the underlined portion introduces a scientific term that is used in the discussion that follows. Choice A is incorrect because the underlined portion of the text doesn’t present any remarks from Melisa Diaz, nor does it suggest that Diaz and her team encountered difficulties in their study. Instead, the phrase in quotation marks in the underlined portion simply presents a term that is used by scientists to refer to a specific process discussed in the text. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in either the underlined portion or the text as a whole suggests that the findings of the study presented in the text were surprising or unexpected. In fact, the text suggests that Diaz and her team wanted to see if aeolian transport could explain the appearance of certain geological materials in Antarctica, and their findings did indeed confirm the involvement of aeolian transport. Choice D is incorrect. Although the first sentence of the text mentions soil and rocks, which are two different kinds of geological material, the underlined portion doesn’t refer to these materials, nor does it explain the difference between them.

The text indicates that climate change is causing the lakes to get deeper, which consequently threatens the wild rice that grows in the area. The text goes on to state that deep water can cause young wild-rice plants to uproot from the bottom of the lake. This context supports the idea that the plants are sensitive to water depth during early stages of development.

Light is not alive, so it can’t consult with Earth. Choice C is incorrect. It’s confusing to say that starlight is ""only now running to Earth,"" both because light doesn’t literally ""run"" and because the text is describing the moment the light touches Earth, not the period of time when it’s traveling to Earth. Choice D is incorrect. This might be tempting, as ""clinging to"" has a connotation of ""sticking to."" It wouldn’t make sense to say that the light was ""only now"" clinging to Earth."

In this context, ""traced"" means tracked back to. The text notes that the regional variety of Spanish spoken in Puerto Rico has its roots in the language of the Taínos and in the West African language of Yoruba. This context supports the idea that the way certain vowel sounds are pronounced in the Puerto Rican dialect can be traced back to Yoruba. Choice B is incorrect because the text presents the statement about the relationship between vowel pronunciation in the Puerto Rican dialect of Spanish and in Yoruba as an example to support the claim that African languages have contributed to the Puerto Rican dialect. It therefore wouldn’t make sense to say that the pronunciation of certain vowel sounds in the Puerto Rican dialect can be ""surrendered,"" or handed over on demand, to the pronunciation in Yoruba. Choice C is incorrect because the text gives no indication that the way certain vowel sounds are pronounced in the Puerto Rican dialect of Spanish has been ""announced,"" or officially declared or proclaimed. According to the text, elements of the dialect have been inherited or borrowed from African languages, and the relationship between the pronunciation of certain vowels in the Puerto Rican dialect and in Yoruba is an example of this inheritance, suggesting that the pronunciation in the Puerto Rican dialect can be traced to Yoruba. Choice D is incorrect because the text presents the statement about the relationship between vowel pronunciation in the Puerto Rican dialect of Spanish and in Yoruba as an example to support the claim that African languages have contributed to the Puerto Rican dialect.

In this context, “acknowledged” means recognized as having a certain status. The text indicates that other researchers recognized Nuttall’s work as groundbreaking because of its “convincing demonstration” related to the age of the ancient sculptures. In other words, the researchers recognized the groundbreaking status of Nuttall’s work. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, “ensured” would mean to have guaranteed or made sure something was the case. The text states that other researchers gave Nuttall’s work recognition after it was published, but there’s no indication that they contributed to the work or had any involvement that would have allowed them to make sure the work would be groundbreaking. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that other researchers “denied,” or refused to admit or accept, that Nuttall’s work was groundbreaking; on the contrary, it indicates that researchers praised the work, recognizing it as groundbreaking due to its “convincing demonstration” related to the age of the ancient sculptures.

In this context, ""requires"" means needs in order to perform a task. The text indicates that because ecosystems span the border, actions taken by the government on one side of the border can affect the environment in the nation on the other side of the border, which makes international cooperation crucial. In other words, because actions on one side of the US and Mexican border can affect the other side of the border, managing environmental matters along the border requires coordination between the two governments.

The text begins by mentioning scholarly accounts of the Chicano movement, which the underlined portion describes as tending ""to focus on the most militant, outspoken figures in the movement,"" making the movement as a whole seem uniformly radical. The text then indicates that the work of geographer Juan Herrera shows that focusing less on such militant figures and instead paying more attention to manifestations of the Chicano movement in less widely known neighborhood institutions and projects would reveal that the movement’s participants embraced a range of political orientations and approaches. Thus, the underlined portion describes a common approach to studying the Chicano movement that, according to the text, obscures the ideological diversity of the movement’s participants. Choice A is incorrect. Though the underlined portion does present a trend in scholarship on the Chicano movement, the text does not indicate that other scholars have reevaluated their methods in light of Herrera’s work. It only indicates that Herrera’s work suggests that the work of those other scholars does not provide a complete picture of the Chicano movement. Choice B is incorrect. Though the underlined portion does identify an aspect of the Chicano movement that the text indicates has been overemphasized, the text does not discuss the political orientations of the scholars whose work is mentioned in the text. Choice D is incorrect. Though the underlined portion does summarize the conventional method for analyzing the Chicano movement, the rest of the text does not address the effectiveness of ""comparatively low-profile neighborhood institutions and projects.""

In this context, “justify” means confirm or give reasons for. The text indicates that scholars have long been skeptical about the supposed Viking origin of two helmets found in Denmark. The radiocarbon dating of the helmets conducted by Vandkilde and colleagues demonstrates that the helmets date from the Nordic Bronze Age, making the helmets too old to have belonged to Vikings. This context supports the idea that the scholars’ skepticism is justified. Choice A is incorrect because “anticipate” means expect or come before, neither of which would make sense in context. The text indicates that scholars have long been skeptical of the idea that the helmets belonged to Vikings. Because the skepticism has existed for a long time, Vandkilde and colleagues’ research couldn’t be said to anticipate it. Instead, the radiocarbon dating results justify or confirm the scholar’s skepticism. Choice B is incorrect because “inspect” means examine or review, which wouldn’t make sense in this context. Research findings are inanimate and therefore unable to inspect scholars’ skepticism. The text focuses on the origin of two helmets, which some people believe belonged to Vikings. Vandkilde and colleagues found that the helmets are from the Nordic Bronze Age and therefore much older than the Vikings. This context suggests that the researchers’ findings justify, not inspect, the scholars’ skepticism. Choice C is incorrect because “reveal” means uncover or report, which wouldn’t make sense in context. The text focuses on the origin of two helmets, which some people believe belonged to Vikings.

Get his mother to apologize for | C. Get his mother to match | D. Get his mother to reunite with,A,"Choice A is the best answer. The expression “reconcile to” means “to cause (a person) to accept something difficult or disagreeable.” The text suggests that John wants his mother to accept his desire to travel, even though she doesn’t like that idea. Choice B is incorrect. This doesn’t make sense. John doesn’t want his mother to apologize for his own desire to travel—he wants her to accept his desire to travel. Choice C is incorrect. The text doesn’t suggest that John wants his mother to match his desire to travel. Rather, he wants her to accept his desire to travel even though she doesn’t like it. Choice D is incorrect. This is tempting, because it seems to pick up on the idea of people “reconciling” after a fight, but it actually doesn’t make sense. The text never suggests that John’s mother was “united with” the idea of him traveling in the past—if anything, it seems like she’s always been against it.

The text describes an experiment wherein space scientists compared plant growth in terrestrial and lunar soil conditions. It then discusses the findings of the study, including the fact that all the seeds germinated but that the plants grown in lunar soil exhibited signs of stress. Choice A is incorrect. The text doesn’t address this question, and never describes any specific characteristics of either soil.

Trace | B. Opinion | C. Dispute | D. Command,A,"Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, “suggestion” most nearly means trace. The text portrays the narrator standing on the deck of a boat, admiring the view of nature afforded by this position: “My soul had left its body to lose itself in the wild unrestrained beauty around me,” says the narrator, “and only left a trembling suggestion of its existence within me.” This intense response to beauty is such that the narrator’s soul seems to disengage from its body, leaving behind only a barely detectible indication of its presence there. In other words, the narrator senses only a trace of soul left in the body. Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts “suggestion” can refer to an implied or indirectly expressed opinion, the text doesn’t portray the narrator expressing an opinion; instead, the narrator is explaining an experience of intense emotion.

In this context, ""engendering"" means producing or causing to exist. The text indicates that the effect of a dramatic increase in the price of vintage cassettes was counterintuitive, or contrary to what would typically be expected. Generally, when prices rise, demand falls—but the text indicates that in this case, buyers who previously had no interest in cassettes ""thronged the market"" (that is, many of them began purchasing cassettes) because they saw the cassettes as potential investments. This context conveys that the rising prices surprisingly produced significant demand, producing many new buyers for vintage cassettes. Choice A is incorrect because the text focuses on a rise in prices of vintage cassettes, and it wouldn’t make sense to describe the price increase itself—rather than sellers of vintage cassettes—as ""exploiting,"" or unfairly or selfishly taking advantage of, demand. Further, wanting to take advantage of new demand would be a motivation for a price increase, not a counterintuitive effect of it. Choice B is incorrect. In this context, ""monetizing"" would mean utilizing as a source of profit, and it wouldn’t make sense to describe a price increase itself, rather than sellers of vintage cassettes, as using demand as a source of profit; moreover, seeking to profit when there’s new demand would be a reason for price increases, not a counterintuitive effect of them. Choice C is incorrect. In this context, ""appraising"" would mean assessing the value or significance of something. The text focuses on a rise in prices of vintage cassettes, and while it would be reasonable to suggest that sellers might have appraised demand for those cassettes, it wouldn’t make sense to suggest that a price increase itself could do such an assessment; moreover, an appraisal of demand would most likely precede a price increase rather than be an effect of it."

In this context, ""marginalize"" means treat as unimportant or relatively powerless within a group or society. The text explains that according to Austin McCoy, historians have tended to treat ""political, business, and labor leaders"" as the ""major actors"" involved in making changes in organized labor in the period after the Second World War. By emphasizing the contributions of these leaders, historians have in effect minimized the contributions of ordinary workers, treating them as relatively unimportant and ""nearly devoid of agency,"" thereby marginalizing them. Choice A is incorrect. In this context, ""epitomize"" would mean either serve as an ideal example of something or make into an example of something, neither of which would make sense. In stating that historians have tended to characterize political, business, and labor leaders as the primary actors responsible for changes in the post-Second World War labor movement in a manner that minimizes the influence of ordinary workers, the text suggests that historians have tended to present ordinary workers as unimportant to or uninfluential within the movement, not that historians themselves serve as examples of ordinary workers, or that historians in their analyses have made ordinary workers into examples of the changes that occurred. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, ""extol"" would mean praise highly or glorify. The text states that historians have tended to present ordinary workers as being ""nearly devoid of agency,"" thereby minimizing their importance. It therefore wouldn’t make sense to say that in doing so, historians have tended to praise or glorify them. Choice D is incorrect because ""substantiate"" would mean verify with evidence, and nothing in the text suggests that historians have verified rank-and-file workers or their contributions in their analyses. If anything, the text suggests the opposite, implying that by minimizing workers’ agency in organized labor, historians have likely overlooked evidence demonstrating their influence."

In this context, “homogeneous” means uniform or of the same kind. The text indicates that some models predict that the distance that bees travel when they’re foraging declines as the density of flowers increases. The text goes on to say, however, that Jha and Kremen identified a circumstance in which bees don’t behave this way. Specifically, if bees encounter “patches of low species richness”—that is, patches in which the flowers are largely from the same species—they’ll travel beyond those patches to get varied food resources. This context thus suggests that bees don’t behave as some models predict if the dense patches of flowers the bees encounter are homogeneous. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that Jha and Kremen found that bees will behave differently than some models predict if the bees encounter flower patches that are not rich in species, not if the flowers are “depleted,” or emptied or reduced in quality or quantity. Although it could be true that bees are likely to leave depleted patches in search of more resources, the text doesn’t indicate that Jha and Kremen investigated that possibility. Choice C is incorrect because there’s no information in the text suggesting that bees will not behave as some models predict if flowers in patches are “immature,” or not fully developed. Instead, the text indicates that Jha and Kremen found that bees will behave contrary to some models’ predictions if the flower patches are not rich in species. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that bees’ behavior will be inconsistent with the predictions of some models if the flower patches that the bees encounter are of low species richness, not if the flowers are in patches that are “dispersed,” or widely scattered. Although the text does describe bees as leaving patches that are not rich in species to forage elsewhere, there’s no suggestion that Jha and Kremen found that the distance between dense flower patches affects whether the bees behave as some models predict."

In this context, “comprises” means constitutes or makes up the totality of, and the text indicates that The House That Will Not Stand had an “all-female cast” that stands in some relationship to “an array of female characters” in the play. Because all cast members are female, the characters must be played by these female cast members; therefore the cast constitutes, or comprises, the collection of characters. Choice A is incorrect.

Had Tuchman consulted secondary works available to her by scholars such as Luigi Albertini, she would not have neglected the influence of events in Eastern Europe on Germany’s actions. Text 2 Barbara Tuchman’s The Guns of August is an engrossing if dated introduction to World War I.

Both texts are critical of The Guns of August , but for different reasons: the author of Text 1 argues that Tuchman missed an important factor leading up to the war because she didn’t consult secondary sources, and the author of Text 2 argues that Tuchman’s main thesis is ""reductive,"" which is a close synonym for ""overly simplistic."" Choice A is incorrect. This doesn’t accurately describe the difference. This choice’s summary of Text 1 is accurate, but Text 2 never says that Tuchman’s most interesting claims result from her original research. Choice C is incorrect. This doesn’t accurately describe the difference. Text 1 never says that The Guns of August is worthwhile to read despite its research weaknesses. Text 2 does call out a weakness of Tuchman’s interpretation of events, but it also praises her analysis of primary sources. Choice D is incorrect. This doesn’t accurately describe the difference. Text 1 actually says that Tuchman ""fails to address"" the influence of events in Eastern Europe, while Text 2 says that Tuchman’s thesis was that European powers (not Eastern European leaders) were committed to military plans."

In the text, Fabry and Busman claim that the robots manufactured by their company are more efficient than human workers, which they refer to as “the human machine.” Fabry observes that the human machine “no longer answers the requirements of modern engineering .” That is, human workers are incapable of meeting the rigorous needs of modern, industrialized workplaces. Choice A is incorrect. Although in some contexts “answers” can mean explains, it doesn’t have that meaning in this context because the topic under discussion is human beings’ inability to perform labor efficiently, not their inability to engage in discussion or explanation. Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts “answers” can mean rebuts, or proves a claim or argument to be false, it wouldn’t make sense to speak of proving requirements to be false; requirements might or might not be reasonable, but they can’t be verified as truthful or untruthful, as claims or accusations can. Choice C is incorrect. Although in some contexts, “answers” can mean defends against criticism, or justifies, it doesn’t have that meaning in this context because the opinion that Fabry expresses is that human workers can no longer fulfill the requirements of modern workplaces, not that they have ceased to justify those requirements or to defend them against criticism; indeed, there is no suggestion in the text that workers ever defended those requirements."

Storey also found that the El Arenal chicken shared a unique genetic mutation with the ancient chicken breeds of the Polynesian Islands in the Pacific. Thus, Polynesian peoples, not later Europeans, probably first introduced chickens to South America. Text 2 An Australian research team weakened the case for a Polynesian origin for the El Arenal chicken by confirming that the mutation identified by Storey has occurred in breeds from around the world. More recently, though, a team led by Agusto Luzuriaga-Neira found that South American chicken breeds and Polynesian breeds share other genetic markers that European breeds lack. Thus, the preponderance of evidence now favors a Polynesian origin.","Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1?","A.

By noting that while the claim is persuasive, the findings of Luzuriaga-Neira’s team provide stronger evidence for it than the findings of the genetic analysis conducted by Storey do",D,"Choice D is the best answer because it accurately describes how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1. Text 1 indicates that Storey found a genetic mutation in South American chickens from before the European invasion and in Polynesian chickens, which implies that chickens were first brought to South America by Polynesian people. Text 2 explains that the genetic mutation Storey found is in chickens from all over the world, thus undercutting the mutation as evidence of a Polynesian origin. However, Text 2 goes on to say “[m]ore recently” Luzuriaga-Neira and colleagues found multiple genetic markers shared by South American and Polynesian chickens but “that European breeds lack,” which strongly suggests a Polynesian origin for the South American chickens. This indicates that the author of Text 2 believes Luzuriaga-Neira’s evidence for a Polynesian origin is compelling while Storey’s evidence has been undermined. Thus, the author of Text 2 would most likely agree with the underlined statement and believes Luzuriaga-Neira and colleagues’ evidence for the statement is stronger than Storey’s evidence is. Choice A is incorrect because both texts indicate that chickens were introduced to South America before the arrival of Europeans. Text 1 states that the El Arenal chicken bone dates from “1321–1407 CE—over a century before Europeans invaded the region” and concludes that these chickens were likely brought to South America by Polynesians. While Text 2 is not as explicit about the time period as Text 1 is, nothing in Text 2 undermines the timing of events ascribed to Storey’s account in Text 1. Choice B is incorrect because both texts agree that chickens were first brought to South America by Polynesian peoples (the underlined claim), and nothing in Text 2 suggests that this claim is in any way deficient because the possibility that animals could have been transferred from South America to Polynesia was not explicitly addressed. Choice C is incorrect because the criticism that Text 2 raises about the ideas in Text 1 is specifically about whether the single genetic mutation cited by Storey in fact supports the idea of a Polynesian origin for South American chickens. There is nothing in Text 2 to suggest that the underlined sentence (Storey’s conclusion) is deficient because it is based on an assumption about the genetic uniformity of European chickens."

The text portrays Miss Pyne as awaiting the arrival of a carriage while Martha brings strawberries and flowers from the garden into the house. The text also describes the surroundings of the scene, stating that Miss Pyne looks ""stately and calm,"" the evening is bright and cool, and birds are singing in the garden as the sun sets. Then the last sentence states that the house was ""wide open to the long-expected guest,"" which strongly suggests that Miss Pyne’s anticipation and Martha’s activities were in preparation for the guest who is expected to arrive in the carriage. Thus, the text depicts the setting and conveys what these characters are doing as they await the arrival of their visitor. Choice A is incorrect because there is nothing in the text to indicate that the characters feel any worry about the guest’s arrival. The text indicates that the guest was ""long-expected,"" but characterizing Miss Pyne as ""stately and calm"" conflicts with the idea that the characters are worried about the guest. Choice B is incorrect because the text describes a moment in time when two characters are awaiting the arrival of a visitor rather than an extended period over which characters could be seen changing.

Choice A is incorrect because neither text discusses nondigital means of displaying art. Choice B is incorrect because the author of Text 2 doesn’t address whether it’s harder to use a tablet and stylus than it is to use paint and a brush. Text 2 does argue that digital art requires skills that aren’t part of the traditional methods for producing art, but the text doesn’t address relative difficulty.

Text 1 focuses on the discovery of a strange fossil consisting of the skull of the extinct species Oculudentavis khaungraae . According to Text 1, the fossil has features that appear to be avian, or related to birds, which led researchers to initially think that the fossil might be a very small avian dinosaur. Text 2 begins by noting the discovery of a second fossil similar to the one discussed in Text 1, then explains that based on detailed studies of both fossils, paleontologists think that the two creatures were probably unusual lizards, even though the skulls appeared avian at first. This suggests that the paleontologists in Text 2 recognize that the fossils do indeed look like they could be related to birds. For this reason, the paleontologists in Text 2 would most likely say that the initial thought of the researchers in Text 1—that the fossil was avian—is understandable, even if the fossil is probably not avian but rather is from a lizard.

The text indicates that diadromous fish differ from euryhaline fish in that diadromous fish ""migrate between freshwater and marine biomes during their life,"" whereas euryhaline fish do not relocate to a different biome because they can tolerate higher salinity environments. Therefore, this context suggests that because of differences between their migration patterns, diadromous fish are distinct and can be demarcated from euryhaline fish. Choice B is incorrect.

Thus, the researchers in Text 2 would most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1 by stating that it reflects an incomplete view of emotional contagion, because the phenomenon can occur without an in-person interaction. Choice A is incorrect. Although the researchers in Text 2 would likely agree that the underlined statement in Text 1 perpetuates a flawed conclusion that emotional contagion requires physical interaction, Text 2 doesn’t address what the researchers thought about smiling as a sign of emotional contagion. Choice C is incorrect because the researchers in Text 2 wouldn’t say that the underlined claim in Text 1 is fairly persuasive. According to Text 2, the researchers conducted a study that found emotional contagion didn’t require physical interaction, because they found evidence of it in text-based online interactions. Choice D is incorrect because neither of the texts claim that emotional contagion primarily occurs when a person is exposed to negativity. Instead, Text 1 claims that physical interaction is required for emotional contagion to occur, and Text 2 describes a study that suggests emotional contagion can occur in text-based online interactions."

Some researchers contend that tectonic movements began around 3 billion years ago, often noting that computer models of Earth’s mantle temperature at the time indicate that the mantle would have been sufficiently molten to enable the plates to move. Text 2 Ultimately, any plausible claim about the inception of tectonic movement must rest on empirical evidence from the geological record. Researcher Wriju Chowdhury and his team analyzed the geochemistry of zircon crystals to gain insight into the chemical composition of the magma from which the crystals formed and, based on the data, compellingly argue that plate tectonics may have been occurring as early as 4.2 billion years ago.","Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to what “some researchers contend” as described in Text 1?",A.

By distinguishing between computer models of Earth’s mantle temperature that reliably predict the onset of plate tectonics and those that do not | C. By indicating that computer models of Earth’s mantle temperature are still being improved such that new models tend to be much more reliable than their predecessors | D. By asserting that a more definitive form of evidence than the computer models suggests a different timeline for the onset of plate tectonics on Earth,D,"Choice D is the best answer because it reflects how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to what the researchers mentioned in Text 1 contend. Text 1 discusses the lack of knowledge of how plate tectonics on Earth began. Text 1 also mentions researchers who contend that movements of tectonic plates began around 3 billion years ago. As support for this assertion, these researchers cite computer models (which are simulations, not empirical evidence) of the temperature in Earth’s mantle that show that at that time, the mantle would have been sufficiently molten for plates to move. However, the author of Text 2 asserts that empirical evidence from the geological record is necessary to make plausible claims about when tectonic movement began. Text 2 mentions an analysis performed by Wriju Chowdhury and his team of the geochemistry of zircon crystals (which would constitute empirical evidence). Chowdhury and his team argue, based on this analysis, that tectonic plates may have begun to move as early as 4.2 billion years ago. Therefore, since the author of Text 2 would consider Chowdhury et al.’s empirical evidence to be more conclusive than the computer models cited in Text 1, the author of Text 2 would most likely assert that a more definitive form of evidence than the computer models suggests a different timeline for the onset of plate tectonics on Earth. Choice A is incorrect because the author of Text 2 makes no claims about the temperature of Earth’s mantle and therefore wouldn’t argue that the temperature of Earth’s mantle 3 billion years ago was insufficient to allow tectonic movement. Choice B is incorrect because the author of Text 2 claims that empirical evidence is needed to fix the earliest date of tectonic movement. Computer models are simulations, not empirical evidence, so the author of Text 2 wouldn’t distinguish between different kinds of computer models but would instead argue that no computer models can reliably predict the onset of plate tectonics. Choice C is incorrect because the author of Text 2 wouldn’t consider any computer model to be able to provide evidence to support a plausible claim about tectonic movement, no matter how much such models were improved. The author of Text 2 would only accept empirical evidence."

The speaker concedes his personal shortcomings, then boasts of his many achievements. | D. The speaker addresses a criticism leveled against him, then announces a grand ambition of his.",D,"Choice D is the best answer because it best describes the overall structure of the text. The speaker begins by stating that he has heard that others are accusing him of seeking to destroy institutions. The speaker then addresses this criticism by stating that he is “neither for nor against institutions.” Instead, the speaker states that his ultimate goal is to instill “the institution of the dear love of comrades” everywhere in the country. Therefore, the overall structure of the text is best described as an address of criticism followed by an announcement of a grand ambition. Choice A is incorrect. While the speaker does address an opinion of him that he believes to be untrue, he doesn’t indicate that this attitude has become increasingly prevalent. The speaker also concludes by explaining his goal for the future rather than his current worldview. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t portray the speaker as isolated or regretful, and the speaker gestures toward a hope for societal change but doesn’t offer an explicit prediction that it will happen. Choice C is incorrect because the speaker addresses a criticism of him that he believes to be false; he doesn’t admit any personal shortcomings.

As used in this context, “predicted” means forecast, or indicated that something would happen in the future. The text indicates that the fashion resale market made a lot of money in 2019 and that some analysts expected the market to continue to grow. This context suggests that the analysts believed that the fashion resale market was going to make more money than it had already made, with the analysts indicating that revenues would more than double by 2028. Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to say that some analysts “produced,” or manufactured or brought about, the increase in future revenues of the fashion resale market. The analysts themselves couldn’t have brought about the future revenue growth, since, as the text suggests, they were merely in the position of drawing conclusions about future fashion resale market revenue based on 2019 revenue. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that some analysts expected the fashion resale market to continue to grow in the future, not that they “denied,” or rejected, this notion. Nothing in the text supports the idea that these analysts thought the revenues wouldn’t grow. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that some analysts expected the fashion resale market to continue to grow in the future, not that they “worried,” or felt concerned, that revenue would significantly increase by 2028. Nothing in the text suggests that the analysts felt concerned about the increase; rather, the text suggests that the increase would represent a favorable outcome, since it would mean that the fashion resale market grew to generate even more revenue."

As used in this context, “extensive” means having a wide or considerable extent. The text indicates that Zepeda’s many accomplishments in linguistics are varied, including teaching linguistics, writing poetry in more than one language, creating a grammar book, and co-founding a language institute. This context supports the idea that Zepeda’s contributions to the field are extensive. Choice A is incorrect because the sentence presents Zepeda’s accomplishments as examples to support the claim made in the first part of the sentence. It wouldn’t make sense to say that achievements as a professor, poet and author, and co-founder of a language institute demonstrate that Zepeda’s contributions in her field are “pragmatic,” or related to practical matters and not involving intellectual or artistic matters. Choice B is incorrect because the sentence presents Zepeda’s accomplishments as a professor, poet and author, and co-founder of a language institute as examples to support the claim made in the first part of the sentence. There’s no reason to believe that the positive achievements listed demonstrate that Zepeda’s contributions in her field are “controversial,” or have caused disputes and opposing viewpoints. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, “universal” would mean including or covering everything in a group. The sentence presents Zepeda’s accomplishments as examples to support the claim made in the first part of the sentence, and it wouldn’t make sense to say that these specific achievements—particularly as the author of a grammar book specific to the Tohono O’odham language—demonstrate that Zepeda’s contributions relate to everything in the field of linguistics."

Fox-Foot, a young Ojibwe man, is guiding a group of fur traders who are traveling by canoe and suspects that they are being followed. At supper time, Fox-Foot would allow no fire to be built, no landing to be made, no trace of their passing to be left. They ate canned meat and marmalade, drank again of the stream and pushed on, until just at dusk they reached the edge of a long, still lake, with shores of granite and dense fir forest.","As used in the text, what does the word “trace” most nearly mean?",A. Evidence | B. Blemish | C. Amount | D. Sketch,A,"Choice A is the best answer because the text indicates that Fox-Foot doesn’t let the group build a fire or create a canoe landing when it’s time for supper. This context suggests that he doesn’t want anyone who might be following the group to see any sign of them or their activities. In other words, Fox-Foot doesn’t want there to be any trace, or evidence, of the group’s movements (""their passing"") through the area. Choice B is incorrect because the text conveys that Fox-Foot doesn’t want the group to be detected, not that he doesn’t want their presence to create a blemish, or a spoiling flaw, in the area; human activity could disturb a natural environment, but the context emphasizes that Fox-Foot is instead focused on avoiding giving any sign of the group’s movements through a place (""their passing"") to anyone who might be following them. Choice C is incorrect because the text focuses on Fox-Foot’s desire to avoid detection by those who might be following the group. This context conveys that Fox-Foot doesn’t want to create any signs or evidence of the group moving through a place (""their passing""), not that he doesn’t want to leave behind some quantity of their presence; indeed, it isn’t clear what an amount of a group’s movement would be. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the group has a sketch, or rough drawing, of their movements through that area (""their passing"") that might be left behind. Rather, the context emphasizes that Fox-Foot is focused on ensuring that the group doesn’t give any kind of indication of their presence, as he wants to avoid detection by anyone who might be following the group."

In this context, “abrupt” means sudden. The text explains that the fossil record reflects the unexpected appearance and rapid diversification, or increase in variety, of animal remains during the Cambrian period. This context establishes that these remains’ entry into the fossil record was sudden. Choice A is incorrect. Although the word “explosion” appears in the name of the event marked by the fossil record change, the text never suggests that the change was “catastrophic,” or disastrous. In context, “explosion” refers to the rapid diversification, or the swift increase in variety, of animal remains in the fossil record—a phenomenon that the text presents in a relatively neutral manner, without commenting on whether it was negative or positive. Choice B is incorrect because the text never suggests that the change toward greater diversification is “elusive,” or difficult to locate, in the fossil record. Rather, the text notes that the change occurred about 541 million years ago, suggesting that scientists have indeed been able to locate it. Choice D is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to describe the change in the fossil record as “imminent,” or about to occur, since the text indicates that the change already occurred millions of years ago."

In this context, “haphazard” means marked by a lack of plan or order. The text indicates that the quest featured in the novel, which involves the protagonist bouncing across time, is chaotic and causes the reader to often wonder what will happen. This context suggests that the protagonist’s journey seems to be marked by a lack of order. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that the journey featured in Yu’s novel involves a character “ricocheting chaotically,” or bouncing in a disordered way, across time and causes the reader to often wonder what will happen. It wouldn’t make sense to say that a chaotic journey seems “premeditated,” or characterized by forethought and planning.

In this context, “collaboration” means working together with someone to write a literary work. The text indicates that most writers prefer to work alone and that working together destroyed the friendship between Hurston and Hughes. This establishes that The Mule Bone is a relatively rare example of collaboration in literature.

In this context, “invalidate” most nearly means nullify or make invalid. The text indicates that interruptions in the supply of microchips for personal electronics “have challenged” the economist’s claim that sales of personal electronics will show strong growth in the coming months. The text goes on to clarify the effect of the delays on the economist’s projection, stating that the delays are very likely to extend the time frame over which the projected growth in sales will occur. This context suggests that the delays are unlikely to invalidate the economist’s projection entirely—the delays will probably alter the time frame of the projection, not nullify it or make it invalid. Choice A is incorrect because saying that the delays are unlikely to “dispute,” or argue against, the economist’s projection wouldn’t make sense. Since the delays are an inanimate circumstance, they couldn’t argue against a prediction about the sales of personal electronics. Choice B is incorrect because saying that the delays are unlikely to “withdraw,” or remove from consideration, the economist’s projection wouldn’t make sense. Although the economist could withdraw her projection because of the delays, the delays themselves couldn’t withdraw her projection since they’re an inanimate circumstance and thus can’t choose to remove something from consideration.

The underlined sentence states that the map ""demonstrates a vast amount of topographic knowledge"" and mentions that it features the ""specific names of mountains and rivers"" and includes the first-known sketch of the Missouri River’s drainage network. These are all characteristics that indicate that the map was executed with remarkable skill. Thus, the underlined sentence identifies some reasons why the map is impressive. Choice A is incorrect. Though the sentence after the underlined sentence in the text mentions that Ac Ko Mok Ki included information about other tribes on his map, the underlined sentence itself does not address this topic.

As used in this context, “proponent of” means supporter of. The text says that Sumner helped to found the psychology department at historically Black Howard University in 1930. This is evidence that Sumner supported increasing the opportunity for Black students to study psychology. Choice B is incorrect because the phrase “supplement to,” or addition to, wouldn’t make sense in context. The text discusses Sumner’s efforts to increase the number of Black psychology students, but it doesn’t make sense to describe him as an addition to his efforts. Choice C is incorrect because Sumner was already an accomplished psychologist himself when he helped to found the Howard University psychology department. While Black students were the beneficiaries of his efforts—that is, they received help because of his efforts—it wouldn’t make sense in this context to describe Sumner as a “beneficiary of” opportunities, because he was the one doing the helping. Choice D is incorrect because founding a psychology department at Howard University wouldn’t be a “distraction for” Sumner’s aim to increase the opportunity for Black students to study psychology—that is, it wouldn’t be something that draws Sumner’s attention away from that goal, but rather the opposite."

In context, “offered” means provided or gave. The text suggests that although it may seem counterintuitive, a broken fossilized trilobite allowed Schoenemann to observe more details of the trilobite’s eye than an intact fossilized trilobite would. This context conveys the idea that a damaged fossil offered, or provided, fresh insight into the structure of a trilobite’s eye. Choice A is incorrect because “resolved” means determined or figured out, which wouldn’t make sense in this context. The text focuses on how Schoenemann was able to get more information from a broken fossil than an intact one. Although the damaged fossil may have allowed her to determine certain information, as an inanimate object the fossil isn’t capable of resolving anything. Choice B is incorrect because saying that the broken part of a trilobite fossil “adjusted,” or changed or modified, fresh insight wouldn’t make sense in this context.

In this context, having a ""reputation for"" something means that one is widely recognized for being associated with a particular activity. The text indicates that Edwards has created ""characteristic works"" including ""esteemed portraits"" of notable figures, suggesting he is known and respected for this type of painting. This choice clearly indicates that Edwards has established recognition or fame specifically in connection with painting portraits of well-known individuals. Choice A is incorrect because the text presents Edwards’s portrait painting in a positive manner, describing his works as ""esteemed."" In this context, ""complaint about"" would mean dissatisfaction or grievance regarding the activity of painting portraits, which contradicts the positive characterization of Edwards’s work. Nothing in the text suggests that Edwards has expressed any dissatisfaction with or objection to painting portraits of notable figures. Choice C is incorrect because the text gives no indication that Edwards has a ""question about"" painting portraits, which in this context would mean uncertainty or doubt regarding this activity. Instead, the text presents Edwards as someone who has already created multiple portrait works described as ""characteristic"" and ""esteemed,"" suggesting established practice rather than uncertainty. The mention of specific examples of his portrait work further demonstrates that he is not questioning his portrait painting. Choice D is incorrect because the text does not suggest that Edwards has a ""requirement for"" painting portraits, which in this context would mean a mandatory obligation or necessary condition. Instead, the text indicates that portrait painting is something Edwards is known for doing well, not something he is obligated to do.

It summarizes the history of a field of thought by discussing two works and then proposes a topic of further research for specialists in that field. | D. It describes two influential works and then explains why one is more widely read than the other.,A,"Choice A is the best answer. The text starts by stating what moral philosophy is concerned with and naming two examples of works in the field. Then it describes a shortcoming of some works in that field (they say how but not why), and finally it states that other works try to avoid that shortcoming (by including both how and why to live a morally good life). Choice B is incorrect. This is too extreme. The text never mentions whether the two works are popular or not, and it never argues that these works don’t serve their intended purpose of describing how to live a morally good life. Rather, the text claims that works of moral philosophy that don’t include both how and why to be moral are not useful to readers who don’t already want to be moral. Choice C is incorrect. This isn’t the overall structure. The text never discusses the history of moral philosophy at all, and it doesn’t propose any topic for further research. Choice D is incorrect.

The first sentence presents the general claim that industrial activity is not always a threat to wildlife. The underlined portion of the sentence that follows suggests that the silver-studded blue butterfly is an example of wildlife thriving in areas of industrial activity: active limestone quarries. Thus, the function of the underlined portion is to introduce a specific example in support of the general claim in the previous sentence. Choice A is incorrect. Although the first sentence indicates that “industrial activity is often assumed” to harm wildlife, in the case of the silver-studded blue butterfly the text mentions neither an assumption about this species nor any challenge to such an assumption.

Anne, an eleven-year-old girl, has come to live on a farm with a woman named Marilla in Nova Scotia, Canada. Anne reveled in the world of color about her. “Oh, Marilla,” she exclaimed one Saturday morning, coming dancing in with her arms full of gorgeous boughs, “I’m so glad I live in a world where there are Octobers. It would be terrible if we just skipped from September to November, wouldn’t it? Look at these maple branches. Don’t they give you a thrill—several thrills? I’m going to decorate my room with them.” “Messy things,” said Marilla, whose aesthetic sense was not noticeably developed. “You clutter up your room entirely too much with out-of-doors stuff, Anne. Bedrooms were made to sleep in.”",Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?,A. To demonstrate that Anne has a newly developed appreciation of nature | B. To describe an argument that Anne and Marilla often have | C. To emphasize Marilla’s disapproval of how Anne has decorated her room | D. To show that Anne and Marilla have very different personalities,D,"Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text. The text begins by noting that Anne “reveled in the world of color about her”—that is, she takes great delight in colorful things. It then relates a scene when she enthusiastically enters the house with autumn foliage and announces that she will decorate her room with it. The focus of the text then shifts to Marilla, who has an undeveloped “aesthetic sense,” or appreciation of beauty, as can be seen when she dismisses the maple leaves as “messy things” and criticizes Anne for cluttering her room with objects from outside. This episode thus illustrates that Anne and Marilla differ in their appreciation of beauty and, more generally, in their basic character: Anne is exuberant and joyful, while Marilla is stern and critical. Therefore, the purpose of the text is to show that Anne and Marilla have very different personalities. Choice A is incorrect because the text presents Anne’s appreciation of nature as a basic personality trait, not as a newfound enthusiasm, and never indicates how recently she developed that appreciation. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text portrays Anne and Marilla as having different personalities and attitudes toward natural beauty and home decoration, it doesn’t show them engaging in an argument about this difference or suggest that they often argue about it. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text does indicate that Marilla disapproves of how Anne plans to decorate her room, Marilla’s disapproval is a supporting detail that serves to develop her personality, which the text as a whole contrasts with Anne’s personality."

In this context, ""fluctuations in"" means irregular changes in. The text notes that economists recommend that countries that want to rely more on solar energy (energy captured from sunlight) should attempt to expand their storage capacity. The text goes on to explain that having a large amount of stored solar energy can lessen the negative effect of ""unpredictable shifts in cloud cover and haze""—that is, unpredictable changes in environmental conditions that at times limit sunlight. This context suggests that having ample solar energy stored and ready to use can mitigate the issue of fluctuations in solar energy collection caused by irregular patterns of sunlight availability. Choice A is incorrect because in this context, ""developments of solar energy collection"" would most clearly refer to the creation of ways to collect solar energy (energy captured from sunlight). The text focuses on collection and the idea that having stored energy can mitigate, or make less bad, the effects of a problem caused by unpredictable changes that affect sunlight (""cloud cover and haze""); there’s no reason to think that the creation of new collection methods would be viewed as a problem that would need to be mitigated. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, ""calibrations with"" would most clearly refer to precise adjustments for a particular purpose. The text focuses on the collection of solar energy (energy captured from sunlight) and the idea that having stored energy can mitigate, or make less bad, the effects of a problem caused by unpredictable changes that affect sunlight (""cloud cover and haze""); there’s no reason to think that precision in something related to solar energy collection would be viewed as a problem that would need to be mitigated. Choice D is incorrect. The text focuses on the collection of solar energy (energy captured from sunlight) and the idea that having stored energy can mitigate, or make less bad, the effects of a problem caused by unpredictable changes that affect sunlight (""cloud cover and haze""); nothing in the text suggests that ""incentives for,"" or rewards for, solar energy collection would be viewed as a problem that would need to be mitigated, especially in countries that want to rely more on solar energy than they already do."

As used in this context, “rudimentary” means basic or unsophisticated. According to the text, a study of the single-celled protozoan Stentor roeseli showed that the organisms can switch strategies for escaping certain stimuli, “sophisticatedly ‘changing their minds’” and using new strategies should other strategies fail. This context suggests that single-celled organisms may not be limited to behaviors that are basic or rudimentary, since the study showed that single-celled protozoans can respond complexly to irritating stimuli. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that single-celled organisms may not be limited to behavior that is “aggressive,” or threatening. Rather, the text suggests that single-celled organisms may not be limited to behaviors that are basic, since the study of Stentor roeseli showed that single-celled protozoans can respond complexly to irritating stimuli.

The narrator begins by explaining how Charlot carefully delivers Atlante’s letter to Rinaldo, and then relates that Rinaldo feels “transported with joy” after reading the letter. Therefore, the overall structure of the text is best described as a description of the delivery of a letter followed by the portrayal of a character’s happiness after reading the letter. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that the letter has been written; there’s no explanation why another character hasn’t written one. In addition, the text’s description of Rinaldo “in a melancholy posture” suggests that he’s sad and thoughtful, not that he’s desperate to receive the letter. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text states that Charlot won’t toss the letter to Rinaldo because she doesn’t want it to fall, the text doesn’t refer to the contents of the letter.

The text introduces the concern that pteropods are thought to be particularly vulnerable to ocean acidification, or lower pH levels, due to the susceptibility of their calcium carbonate shells to dissolution at lower pH levels. However, the text then describes findings from a recent study that suggest this concern may be unjustified, insofar as the protective periostracum coating on a pteropod’s shell prevents dissolution, and even when the coating is breached, a pteropod can rebuild the inner shell wall, reducing the damage.

Such findings support the consensus view among researchers of curiosity: namely, that curiosity is not instrumental but instead represents a drive to acquire information for its own sake. Text 2 While acknowledging that acquiring information is a powerful motivator, Rachit Dubey and colleagues ran an experiment to test whether emphasizing the usefulness of scientific information could increase curiosity about it. They found that when research involving rats and fruit flies was presented as having medical applications for humans, participants expressed greater interest in learning about it than when the research was not presented as useful.","Based on the texts, how would Dubey and colleagues (Text 2) most likely respond to the consensus view discussed in Text 1?",A. By suggesting that curiosity may not be exclusively motivated by the desire to merely acquire information | B. By conceding that people may seek out information that serves no immediate purpose only because they think they can use it later | C. By pointing out that it is challenging to determine when information-seeking serves no goal beyond acquiring information | D. By disputing the idea that curiosity can help explain apparently purposeless information-seeking behaviors,A,"Choice A is the best answer. The researchers in Text 2 recognize that acquiring information is a powerful motivator, but showed that this motivation can still be affected by other factors, like whether or not the information is expected to be useful or not. This suggests that other desires may play a part in driving people to acquire information. Choice B is incorrect. The consensus view in Text 1 is that people acquire information regardless of whether they think they can use it later. Dubey and colleagues acknowledge this fact (so they don’t claim people seek out information “only” because it might be useful later). Choice C is incorrect. This choice misreads the results of Dubey and colleagues’ study in Text 2. Neither text discusses the difficulty of determining the motivation for information-seeking. Choice D is incorrect. This choice contradicts Text 2, which starts with Dubey and colleagues “acknowledging that acquiring information is a powerful motivator” (i.e., agreeing that curiosity explains the seeking of apparently purposeless information). The research in Text 2 simply suggests that more than just curiosity can motivate information-seeking behavior when the information has a purpose."

The shift to agriculture about 12,000 years ago sparked population growth that led to the emergence of groups with hierarchical structures: associations of clans first, then chiefdoms, and finally, bureaucratic states. Text 2 In a 2021 book, anthropologist David Graeber and archaeologist David Wengrow maintain that humans have always been socially flexible, alternately forming systems based on hierarchy and collective ones with decentralized leadership. The authors point to evidence that as far back as 50,000 years ago some hunter-gatherers adjusted their social structures seasonally, at times dispersing in small groups but also assembling into communities that included esteemed individuals.","Based on the texts, how would Graeber and Wengrow (Text 2) most likely respond to the “conventional wisdom” presented in Text 1?",A. By conceding the importance of hierarchical systems but asserting the greater significance of decentralized collective societies | B. By disputing the idea that developments in social structures have followed a linear progression through distinct stages | C. By acknowledging that hierarchical roles likely weren’t a part of social systems before the rise of agriculture | D. By challenging the assumption that groupings of hunter-gatherers were among the earliest forms of social structure,B,"Choice B is the best answer because it describes the most likely way that Graeber and Wengrow (Text 2) would respond to the “conventional wisdom” presented in Text 1. According to Text 1, the conventional wisdom about human social systems is that they developed through stages, beginning with hunter-gatherer bands, then moving to clan associations, then chiefdoms, and finally arriving at states with bureaucratic structures. Text 2 indicates that Graeber and Wengrow believe that human social systems have been flexible, shifting between different types of structures, including both hierarchical and collective systems, and that these shifts may have even occurred seasonally. This suggests that Graeber and Wengrow would dispute the idea that developments in social structures have followed a linear progression through distinct stages. Choice A is incorrect because nothing in Text 2 suggests that Graeber and Wengrow believe that decentralized collective societies are more significant than hierarchical systems. Text 2 is focused on Graeber and Wengrow’s view that humans have flexibly shifted among various social structures, not on the importance of particular structures relative to others. Choice C is incorrect because Text 2 doesn’t include any information suggesting that Graeber and Wengrow believe that hierarchies didn’t emerge until after the rise of agriculture. In fact, Text 2 indicates that Graeber and Wengrow cite evidence suggesting that some hunter-gatherer groups formed social structures with hierarchical elements (“communities that included esteemed individuals”) 50,000 years ago, long before the rise of agriculture, which Text 1 says occurred around 12,000 years ago. Choice D is incorrect because there’s no information in Text 2 suggesting that Graeber and Wengrow would challenge the assumption that groupings of hunter-gatherers were among the earliest forms of social structure. Although Text 1 does indicate that hunter-gatherer groups are assumed to be the earliest human social system, Text 2 says only that Graeber and Wengrow believe that some hunter-gatherer groups made use of different social structures at different times. Text 2 doesn’t imply that Graeber and Wengrow doubt that hunter-gatherer groups preceded most other social structures."

To account for this discrepancy, Joshua H. Miller and Carl Simpson proposed that arctic temperatures could preserve a mammoth carcass on the surface, allowing it to leach DNA into the environment, for several thousand years. Text 2 Wang and colleagues concede that eDNA contains DNA from both living organisms and carcasses, but for DNA to leach from remains over several millennia requires that the remains be perpetually on the surface. Scavengers and weathering in the Arctic, however, are likely to break down surface remains well before a thousand years have passed.",Which choice best describes how Text 1 and Text 2 relate to each other?,"A. Text 1 discusses two approaches to studying mammoth extinction without advocating for either, whereas Text 2 advocates for one approach over the other. | B.

Text 1 describes Wang and colleagues’ study and a critique of their methodology, whereas Text 2 offers additional details showing that methodology to be sound. | D. Text 1 argues that new research has undermined the standard view of when mammoths went extinct, whereas Text 2 suggests a way to reconcile the standard view with that new research.",B,"Choice B is the best answer. Text 1 introduces Wang and colleagues’ study and its surprising results, and then mentions Miller and Simpson’s hypothesis as a possible way to explain them. Text 2, however, challenges Miller and Simpson’s hypothesis by pointing out the difficulties of preserving mammoth carcasses on the surface for thousands of years: “scavengers and weathering” are the additional details that complicate the Miller/Simpson hypothesis. Choice A is incorrect. Neither text compares two different approaches for studying mammoth extinction. Text 1 describes one study and one hypothesis pertaining to it. Text 2 critiques that hypothesis. Choice C is incorrect. Text 1 does not describe a critique of Wang and colleagues’ methodology, but rather an interpretation of their results by Miller and Simpson. Text 2 does not offer additional details showing that methodology to be sound, but rather casts doubt on the Miller/Simpson explanation. Choice D is incorrect. Both components mentioned here (the new “undermining” research and the theory for reconciling this discovery) are contained in Text 1. Text 2 then shows how the attempt to reconcile the standard view and new research is flawed, and still fails to explain the discrepancy."

Choice D is incorrect. In some contexts, ""void"" can mean devoid of, or lacking, a particular element, and such a lack could be conceived of as incompleteness. However, the text doesn’t portray summer as not being complete or whole; instead, it characterizes vacancy or inactivity as being an essential quality of the season, as experienced by the speaker."

It makes an extended comparison of night to a human being. | D. It portrays how night changes from one season of the year to the next.",C,"Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes the overall structure of the text. Throughout the text, the speaker characterizes nighttime as if it were a person who wears clothing (“a garment” that is “velvet soft” and “violet blue”) and a veil “over her face” and who moves her hands “slowly with their gem-starred light” through her dark hair. Thus, the text is structured as an extended comparison of night to a human being. Choice A is incorrect because the text never mentions any particular location; instead, it focuses on presenting a single description of night as a person with certain clothing and features. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t make any reference to the sun or sunrise; instead, it focuses on presenting a single image of night as a person with certain clothing and features. Choice D is incorrect. Rather than describing how nighttime changes seasonally (or in any other way), the text presents a single image of night as a person with certain clothing and features."

In this context, “conform to” means to act in accordance with something. The text suggests that in her science fiction writing, Jemisin’s willingness to go against expectations and not use plots and themes that seem to follow a formula reflects how she treats the standard practices of the genre. This context conveys that Jemisin chooses not to act in accordance with those conventions. Choice A is incorrect. In this context, “question” would mean doubt or object to. The text indicates that Jemisin is willing to go against expectations and not use formulaic plots and themes in her science fiction writing, suggesting that she may actually object to those conventions of the genre, not that she chooses not to question them. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that in her science fiction writing, Jemisin is willing to go against expectations and not use formulaic plots and themes. Rather than suggesting that Jemisin chooses not to “react to,” or act in response to, the standard practices of the genre, this context suggests that she is acting in response to such conventions by deliberately avoiding them. Choice C is incorrect. In this context, “perceive” would mean become aware of or understand. The text indicates that in her science fiction writing, Jemisin is willing to go against expectations and not use formulaic plots and themes.

Delany’s character Rydra Wong. As used in this context, “atypical” would mean unrepresentative or not common. The text indicates that Wong is one of “nearly a dozen” characters in Delany’s novels who are poets or writers. This context conveys that being a poet isn’t an atypical occupation for a character in one of Delany’s works. Choice A is incorrect because “infallible” means to be accurate or without fault, which wouldn’t make sense in context. The text focuses on the fact that Delany has written many characters who are poets and writers. This context suggests that the occupation isn’t atypical for Delany, not that the occupation isn’t infallible, or problematic. Choice C is incorrect because “lucrative” means to be profitable, which wouldn’t make sense in context. If writing poet characters weren’t profitable, it wouldn’t be logical to explain this by citing that Delany gave many of his characters the same occupation. Choice D is incorrect because “tedious” means to be boring, which wouldn’t make sense in context. The text focuses on the fact that Delany has written many characters who are poets and writers.

In this context ""overtly"" means openly or without concealment. The text draws a contrast between the lack of ""deliberately signaled"" political themes in woman-authored science fiction from the 1920s to the 1960s and what Yaszek notes about woman-authored science fiction from the 1970s. This contrast implies that the work from the 1970s did clearly reflect feminist political themes. In other words, the text indicates that unlike women who wrote science fiction in the 1920s to the 1960s, the women who wrote science fiction in the 1970s expressed overtly feminist themes. Choice A is incorrect. In this context ""prudently"" would mean cautiously, which might plausibly describe the women who wrote science fiction from the 1920s to the 1960s, in that they tended to avoid revealing their political views; however, the text contrasts these authors with the women writing science fiction in the 1970s, thereby suggesting that the authors writing in the 1970s were not restrained in that way. Choice C is incorrect because in this context ""cordially"" would mean politely, and nothing in the text indicates that politeness was a significant factor for women writing science fiction either from the 1920s to the 1960s or in the 1970s. The text draws a contrast between the lack of ""deliberately signaled"" political themes in woman-authored science fiction from the 1920s to the 1960s and what Yaszek notes about woman-authored science fiction from the 1970s. It’s unclear how ""less deliberately signaled"" politics and an increasing sense of politeness toward feminism would constitute a meaningful contrast. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, ""inadvertently"" would mean unintentionally, and nothing in the text suggests that Yaszek thought the feminist elements of the woman-authored science fiction from the 1970s arose without deliberate effort."

In this context, ""tranquil"" means free from disturbance, or calm. The text indicates that ocean currents are powerful and make it difficult for marine animals to hide from predators and that kelp forests slow currents down to create calmer areas. In other words, kelp forests create a more tranquil environment. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that kelp forests provide shelter for marine animals, meaning they create environments that are safer, not more ""dangerous."" Choice C is incorrect because the text discusses how kelp forests affect currents in the ocean, and it isn’t clear how an ocean environment could be ""imaginative,"" or full of imagination.

As used in this context, “overshadowed by” means to be surpassed by or caused to seem less important than other factors affecting a move. The text indicates that, according to a US tax policy expert, when people think about an interstate move, state taxes have little effect on their decisions, while employment opportunities, housing availability, and climate have a very strong effect. This context suggests that people consider these other factors to be more important than state taxes. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that state taxes aren’t as important a consideration as other factors when people are thinking of moving to another state. The context doesn’t suggest that state taxes are “consistent with,” or in agreement with these other factors. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to say that state taxes are “representative of,” or typical of, other factors. Taxes aren’t an example of employment opportunities, housing availability, and climate, which are the other factors listed in the text. Choice D is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to say that state taxes are “irrelevant to,” or unconnected or unimportant to other factors. State taxes are irrelevant to peoples’ decisions, not to other factors. In other words, although the text suggests that state taxes may be irrelevant to people considering a move to another state, the other factors mentioned in the text, such as employment opportunities, are unable to have an opinion about state taxes. Furthermore, the text indicates that significant differences in state taxes have almost no effect on peoples’ choices to move, but they aren’t completely unimportant."

It was only a little out-of-the-way store which subsisted chiefly on the framing of pictures. The old man looked around at his views of the city, his pictures of cats and dogs, his flaming bits of landscape. “Don’t belong in here,” he fumed.

To describe the items that the shop owner most highly prizes | D. To explain differences between the new picture and other pictures in the shop,A,"Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text. The text begins by stating that the new picture “failed to fit in” with the other items that the shop owner has. The text goes on to illustrate that point by describing the other pictures the shop owner has, indicating that the shop owner is fuming because he doesn’t think the new picture belongs in the store. In the second paragraph, however, the text indicates that the shop owner is “secretly proud of his acquisition.” The main purpose of the text is thus to reveal the shop owner’s conflicted feelings about the new picture. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that the shop owner resents the young man who sold him the new picture; in fact, the text gives no indication of the owner’s feelings about the young man at all. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text indicates that the new picture is different from the other items in the shop, there’s no suggestion that the shop owner prizes either the new picture or the pictures of the city, pets, and landscapes more than he prizes any other items. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t describe what the new picture looks like; rather, the text identifies some of the other kinds of images that the shop owner has and states that they’re different from the new picture without explaining how they’re different."

It describes a limitation of earlier historians’ studies of medieval European bathing habits. | C. It concedes that not all people in medieval Europe had access to public bathhouses. | D. It explains why Janega decided to study the popularity of public bathhouses in medieval Europe.,C,"Choice C is the best answer because it most effectively describes the function of the underlined portion. The text discusses the long-standing misconception that people in medieval Europe were uninterested in cleanliness and hygiene. As evidence that this idea is false, the text cites historian Eleanor Janega’s assertion that in medieval Europe, towns usually had at least one bathhouse, where people could take immersion baths or steam baths for a fee. The underlined portion then notes that mainly town dwellers had access to these bathhouses. The remainder of the text explains that those who lacked such access were nonetheless able to bathe in outdoor waterways or take sponge baths at home. Therefore, the underlined portion concedes that some people in medieval Europe lacked access to public bathhouses. Choice A is incorrect. The underlined portion establishes that amenities such as steam baths were mainly available to town dwellers, which suggests in turn that steam baths were largely unavailable to people in rural areas. Thus, the distinction made by the underlined portion is not between the popularity of steam baths in towns versus their lack of popularity in rural areas but instead between their presence in towns and absence in rural areas. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text does explain that recent historians have disproved the idea that medieval Europeans rarely bathed, it doesn’t attribute that misconception to earlier historians of medieval Europe or suggest that their research was subject to limitations. Moreover, the underlined portion addresses a limitation of life in medieval Europe, not of historical research. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined portion doesn’t address why historian Eleanor Janega decided to study the popularity of public bathhouses in medieval Europe—nor does any portion of the text. The text mentions Janega in passing, but it doesn’t go into detail about why she decided to study the popularity of public bathhouses in medieval Europe."

The text indicates that there is a connection between Thomas’s work and the flowers and trees in her home’s garden, giving the example of Thomas’s brushstrokes being inspired by light shining through the leaves of a tree in front of her house. This context conveys that Thomas’s work was influenced by the flowers and trees in the garden. Choice A is incorrect because the text conveys that Thomas drew inspiration for her work from the plants in her garden, which suggests that the flowers and trees contributed positively to her work, not that they ""restricted,"" or limited, her work. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to suggest that flowers and trees in a garden could have ""announced,"" or made known, a painter’s work.

After introducing Derksen, the text describes how the songs Derksen composed for her album Orchestral Powwow feature aspects of the two musical traditions. Specifically, the text notes that Derksen wrote songs in the style of traditional powwow music but accompanied them with classical arrangements played by an orchestra that followed the beat of a powwow drum rather than the directions of a conductor. In this way, Derksen’s compositions blend different cultures. Choice B is incorrect because although the text suggests that Derksen’s songs contain innovative elements since they blend styles from two different musical traditions, it doesn’t discuss whether her compositions constitute a new style of music, let alone whether Derksen should be recognized for creating a new style of music. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t mention any difficulties Derksen encountered when producing her album. Rather, the text describes how the songs on the album exemplify how Derksen combines music from two different cultures.

In this context, “provide” means make available or supply. The text states that the archaeologists believe that the amphitheater dates to the fourth century CE. The text goes on to say that the archaeologists discovered a coin made between 337 and 341 CE (that is, made during the fourth century CE) and building materials appropriate to the era in question. This context suggests that these discoveries provide evidence for the archaeologists’ theory about the dating of the amphitheater. Choice A is incorrect because the archaeologists’ discoveries are presented as supplying evidence in favor of their theory about the dating of the amphitheater, not something that would “dismiss,” or reject serious consideration of, evidence for that theory.

In this context, “created” means produced. The text explains that Jeyifous, a photographer and neurobiologist, photographed adults who had appeared as children in posters from the 1970s, then combined those photographs with magnified images of the adults’ cells—a process that resulted in what he called “micro and macro portraiture.” This context suggests that Jeyifous drew on his dual interests in photography and neurobiology to produce the images for display in the exhibition. Choice A is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that Jeyifous “validated,” or corroborated, the series of images. The text describes Jeyifous’s process for composing the images but doesn’t describe Jeyifous making an effort to evaluate the images for their artistic or scientific legitimacy. Choice C is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that Jeyifous “challenged,” or disputed, an aspect of the images; rather, the focus of the text is on the inspiration behind the images and the method Jeyifous used to achieve them. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that Jeyifous made the images himself using a combination of photography and magnified pictures of cells, not that he “restored,” or reconditioned, the images from a deteriorated state."

The text describes the exhibit as ""essential viewing,"" suggesting that it’s an important exhibit that people should make an effort to visit; this context conveys that it would be a mistake to overlook the exhibit. Choice A is incorrect. In this context, ""complicate"" would mean to add difficulty, and there’s no reason to think the text would need to directly caution against complicating Baker’s exhibit; the text focuses on the idea that the exhibit is ""essential viewing,"" not on the idea of a potential difficulty that could be raised. Choice B is incorrect. In this context, ""amplify"" means to increase, and there’s no reason to believe the text would indicate that it would be a mistake to increase an exhibit the text describes as ""essential viewing.""

In this context, ""esteem"" means high regard. The text indicates that Franklin was very popular, or highly regarded, in France, where he sought the country’s support for the United States in its fight for independence, and indicates that his status helped him achieve his goal. The context therefore suggests that being held in high regard by the people likely helped Franklin convince France to help the United States. Choice A is incorrect because the text directly indicates that it was Franklin’s popularity that likely helped him convince France to help the United States, not his ""thoughtfulness"" (which in this context would mean either his careful reasoning and attention or his kind consideration of others’ needs).

On the other hand, tropical mountain bird species tend to be limited in the types of spaces they can call home. This is because many mountain bird species are only able to survive at very specific elevations. Over time, these species have likely become used to living at a specific temperature. Therefore, these species struggle to survive at elevations that are warmer or colder than they are used to. Text 2 A new study reviewed observations of nearly 3,000 bird species to understand why tropical mountain bird species live at specific elevations. They noted that when a mountain bird species was found in an area with many other bird species, it tended to inhabit much smaller geographic areas. It is thus likely that competition for resources with other species, not temperature, limits where these birds can live.","Based on the texts, both authors would most likely agree with which statement?",A.

Little is known about how tropical mountain birds build their nests. | D. Tropical mountain bird species that live at high elevations tend to be genetically similar.,A,"Choice A is the best answer. Both texts state that tropical mountain bird species have limited ranges or habitats, although they disagree on the reason for this. Text 1 claims that temperature is the main factor that determines where these birds can live, while Text 2 claims that competition with other species is the main factor. However, both texts agree that these birds are not able to survive in many kinds of areas. Choice B is incorrect. Neither text mentions the tools or methods that scientists use to observe these birds, either now or in the past. Choice C is incorrect.

It identifies the reason particular bird species dig nests in Atacama Desert soil. | D. It explains how certain birds promote seed germination in Atacama Desert soil.,D,"Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined portion functions in the text as a whole. The first two sentences establish a natural phenomenon: there is a richness of plant life found in the Atacama Desert despite the hard soil that makes it challenging for seeds to germinate. The next sentence, which contains the underlined portion, offers a potential explanation for the phenomenon: local birds dig ground nests exposing seeds to moisture and materials in the soil necessary for germination. The last sentence summarizes a study that compared the fertileness of mounds of dirt dug up by birds to mounds that were undisturbed to support the explanation in the underlined portion. Thus, the underlined portion mainly functions to explain how certain birds promote seed germination in the Atacama Desert soil. Choice A is incorrect because the underlined portion doesn’t address the topic of the soil’s tough crust or its formation. Instead, the text elaborates on the idea that local birds that build ground nests may help seeds germinate in the hard soil. Choice B is incorrect because the underlined portion describes how some birds may support seed germination in Atacama Desert soil but doesn’t describe how the seeds are deposited into the soil before germination begins. Choice C is incorrect because neither the underlined portion nor the text as a whole identifies a reason that a particular bird species may choose to dig ground nests in the Atacama Desert soil."

This specific, or particular, view has always been special to Moss, a lifetime resident of West Oakland. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text itself is a work of fiction, the view is something Moss can point out to his companions on the train, so the view itself is presumably not imaginary. Choice B is incorrect. Although this view of the Port of Oakland is significant to Moss, nothing in the text describes the view as particularly energetic as opposed to calming, for example. Choice C is incorrect.

In this context, ""accidental"" means unplanned or unintentional. The text first describes Bastos’s study, which concerns a kea that is observed using small stones to preen its feathers. The text then mentions colleagues who are skeptical (that is, they have doubt) about Bastos’s findings, and finally describes how Bastos and her team responded to the skepticism of those colleagues. Given that the colleagues mentioned in the text expressed skepticism regarding Bastos’s findings, the best answer choice must be one that completes the text in a manner such that the skeptics’ opinion regarding the kea’s use of stones disagrees with that held by Bastos and her team. Since Bastos and her team showed that the kea’s use of stones was deliberate (that is, intentional), the skeptics’ opinion in this context must be that the kea’s use of stones was unintentional, or accidental. Choice A is incorrect because the best answer choice is one that portrays skepticism, or doubt, of Bastos’s claim that the kea’s usage of stones was deliberate, or intentional. If the skeptics found the kea’s usage of stones ""intriguing,"" or fascinating, this would not be at odds with the position of Bastos and her team; in fact, it is reasonable to believe that someone who agreed that the kea’s stone usage was deliberate would also find it intriguing.

The text indicates that to achieve this aim, Francie works systematically and persistently: she reads all the books in the library in alphabetical order and devotes much time and effort to the project, finishing one book per day over a long period of time. The text then suggests that even though she progresses slowly (""she was still in the B’s"") and that she struggled with some books (""some of the B’s had been hard going""), she doesn’t give up because she thinks of herself as ""a reader."" These details show Francie’s resolve. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text mentions several topics (bees and buffaloes, Bermuda vacations, and Byzantine architecture) that Francie has read about, it doesn’t indicate that any of these topics are unusual or that she especially enjoyed reading about one of these topics in particular. If anything, the text suggests that she may have found some of these topics to be dull, saying that she even read the ""dry ones""—that is, the boring books—and that some of the books were ""hard going,"" meaning they were difficult to get through. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t discuss Francie’s involvement in other activities, only her dedication to reading. Although it’s possible that Francie dedicates herself to reading because she prefers it to other activities, the text doesn’t indicate whether this is the case. Choice D is incorrect.

It provides a historical anecdote about the technological challenges involved in reading the earliest interactive texts.,A,"Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined portion functions in the text as a whole. The first sentence of the text introduces literary scholar Jeremy Douglass’s warning to technology investors and enthusiasts against predicting the displacement of conventional books by newer media forms. The next sentence, which is underlined in part, presents Douglass’s observation that interactive texts are hardly new; they have been available for longer than technologists assume, beginning with the first time readers wrote notes in texts’ margins.

According to conventional wisdom , one species should emerge after outcompeting the rest. So why do so many species remain? Ecologists’ many efforts to explain this phenomenon still haven’t uncovered a satisfactory explanation. Text 2 Ecologist Michael Behrenfeld and colleagues have connected phytoplankton’s diversity to their microscopic size. Because these organisms are so tiny, they are spaced relatively far apart from each other in ocean water and, moreover, experience that water as a relatively dense substance. This in turn makes it hard for them to move around and interact with one another. Therefore, says Behrenfeld’s team, direct competition among phytoplankton probably happens much less than previously thought.","Based on the texts, how would Behrenfeld and colleagues (Text 2) most likely respond to the “conventional wisdom” discussed in Text 1?",A. By arguing that it is based on a misconception about phytoplankton species competing with one another | B. By asserting that it fails to recognize that routine replenishment of ocean nutrients prevents competition between phytoplankton species | C. By suggesting that their own findings help clarify how phytoplankton species are able to compete with larger organisms | D. By recommending that more ecologists focus their research on how competition among phytoplankton species is increased with water density,A,"Choice A is the best answer because based on Text 2, it represents how Behrenfeld and colleagues would most likely respond to the “conventional wisdom” discussed in Text 1. The conventional wisdom cited holds the opinion that when there is species diversity within a phytoplankton population, “one species should emerge after outcompeting the rest”—that is, after being so successful in competing for resources that the other species vanish from the population. However, Text 2 explains that according to Behrenfeld and colleagues, phytoplankton are so small and spaced so far apart in the water that there is “much less” direct competition for resources within phytoplankton populations than scientists had previously thought. Choice B is incorrect because Text 2 never discusses whether routine replenishment of ocean nutrients affects competition between phytoplankton species. Choice C is incorrect because the interspecies competition discussed in both texts is specifically between phytoplankton species, and neither text considers whether phytoplankton compete for resources with larger nonphytoplankton species.

Faintly | B. Hastily | C. Easily | D. Foolishly,C,"Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text, “simply” most nearly means easily, or involving minimal difficulty or effort. The text first provides Alice’s reflections on her plan to gain access to a garden and then offers commentary on her plan by the novel’s narrator. The text indicates that a reason Alice likes her plan despite not being fully thought through is that she nonetheless believes it can be efficiently arranged. In other words, the text indicates that one of the supposed benefits of Alice’s plan is that it can be easily arranged. Choice A is incorrect because the text describes how Alice’s plan can be arranged, and it wouldn’t make sense to say that it can be arranged “faintly,” or with little strength or not strongly. Instead, the text indicates that the plan can be arranged with little difficulty. Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts “simply” can mean quickly, hastily, or hurriedly, the word “hastily” indicates that something is done too quickly. Although it may be true that Alice’s plan was made in haste, the text doesn’t focus on this aspect of her plan. Instead, the text focuses on the plan’s seemingly good qualities, saying that Alice thinks of it as “the best,” and the narrator refers to it as “excellent” and “neatly,” or efficiently, arranged. Choice D is incorrect. Although in some contexts “simply” can mean foolishly, or lacking good sense, it doesn’t have this meaning in this context. Although the text says that Alice doesn’t know how to go about her plan, it begins by presenting her plan in a positive light: Alice describes her plan as “the best,” and the narrator refers to the plan as “excellent” and “neatly,” or efficiently, arranged."

The third sentence makes a generalization, asserting that evolutionary links between predators and prey can persist across great expanses of time and distance. This generalization is exemplified by the text’s discussion of the relationship between mimosa trees and B. terrenus beetles. When mimosa trees were introduced to North America in 1785, no B. terrenus beetles were present, so the relationship between the trees and the beetles that exists in their native East Asia was disrupted. When the beetles were introduced to North America more than 200 years later, however, they quickly attacked mimosa trees, illustrating the generalization that links between predators and prey ""can persist across centuries and continents."" Choice A is incorrect because the third sentence doesn’t indicate that Chang and colleagues were investigating any hypothesis. According to the text, Chang and colleagues were simply monitoring mimosa trees when the beetles happened to be introduced to the area.

In this context, ""diminish"" means reduce or lessen. The text establishes that birds sing to communicate over potentially large distances and that researchers believe that birds that live in densely vegetated habitats sing at lower frequencies than birds that live in comparatively sparsely vegetated habitats. The text then explains that researchers hold this belief due to some effect of dense vegetation on the distance that high-frequency sounds can travel. If birds sing to communicate over long distances, it would be logical to conclude that researchers believe that birds in densely vegetated habitats sing at lower frequencies than birds in relatively sparse habitats do because dense vegetation diminishes the distance that high-frequency sounds can travel. Choice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that dense vegetation can ""exceed,"" or surpass or go beyond, the distance that high-frequency sounds can travel. The text suggests that dense vegetation reduces the distance that high-frequency sounds can travel, not that dense vegetation goes farther than that distance. Choice C is incorrect because it would not be sensible to say that dense vegetation can ""encompass,"" or enclose or encircle, the distance that high-frequency sounds can travel. The distance that sounds can travel is not an object that can be enclosed or encircled by vegetation. Choice D is incorrect because there is no information in the text indicating that dense vegetation can ""conceal,"" or hide or keep from being observed, the distance that high-frequency sounds travel. Instead, the text suggests that dense vegetation reduces the distance that high-frequency sounds can travel."

As used in this context, “creating” means producing or bringing something into existence. The text indicates that Gilliam is an artist who made draped canvases and, later, quilt-like paintings. This context supports the idea that Gilliam explored different styles in his art by creating special types of paintings. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that Gilliam actually explored and pursued the creation of quilt-like paintings; he wasn’t just “predicting,” or declaring in advance, the existence of these paintings. Choice B is incorrect because in this context “refusing” would mean rejecting, and there is nothing in the text to suggest that Gilliam rejected his quilt-like paintings.

The text indicates that ""for as long as he could remember,"" Max had ""begged"" his father to take him to La Reina. This point is later emphasized in the text by indicating that ""this summer"" his father might ""finally take"" Max to visit La Reina. Thus, the purpose of the text as a whole is to show how much Max wants to visit La Reina. Choice A is incorrect. The text does not discuss Papa’s feelings toward Max. Rather, it mentions that Max has long wanted Papa to take him to La Reina and that, unlike Max and some other children, Papa does not believe that La Reina is haunted. Choice B is incorrect.

In this context, to ""confirm"" means to establish the truth or correctness of something. The text explains that maize ""shows so little resemblance to any wild plant that genetic research was necessary"" to establish its ancestry, which was ultimately traced to teosinte grass. This context conveys the idea that scientific verification was required to establish an ancestral relationship with certainty—that is, to confirm teosinte grass as maize’s ancestor. Choice A is incorrect because to ""acquire"" means to obtain or gain possession of something. Although their research likely required scientists to acquire samples of maize and teosinte grass, the text does not suggest that this was the ultimate goal of their work, which instead probed the connection between the two plants. Choice B is incorrect because to ""develop"" means to create something or to promote the growth of something, and the ancestral relationship between teosinte grass and maize already existed as a biological fact in the deep past, which scientists then verified through research; because this relationship already existed, the scientists can’t be said to have either created it or encouraged its growth.

In this context, ""exploited"" means made productive use of. The text indicates that the magnetic fields of some metals change under stress and that Saleem and colleagues showed that it is possible to measure those changes from a distance, thereby demonstrating that the integrity of underground metal pipes can be evaluated without having to unearth them. This context thus indicates that Saleem and colleagues made productive use of, or exploited, this tendency of the metals’ magnetic fields. Choice A is incorrect because in this context, ""hypothesized"" would mean made a tentative assumption to be evaluated in a study or experiment. Although Saleem and colleagues may have had one or more hypotheses for these experiments, the text presents the information about the tendency of some metals’ magnetic fields to change under stress as a known fact that the researchers made productive use of, not as a hypothesis to be evaluated. The text after the colon indicates that the researchers were not evaluating whether such changes occur but whether those changes can be measured at a distance. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, ""discounted"" would mean downplayed or ignored, but the text does not suggest that Saleem and colleagues minimized or ignored the tendency of the magnetic fields of some metals to change under stress. Rather, the text indicates that this tendency is the basis for Saleem and colleagues’ method of assessing the pipes’ integrity. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text indicates that Saleem and colleagues ""redefined,"" or reevaluated or reformulated, the tendency of some metals’ magnetic fields to change under stress.

In this context, ""ambiguity"" means uncertainty or doubtfulness. The text explains that although skeptics had thought that direct evidence of gravitational waves would be too faint to be detected, researchers led by González claimed that a chirping sound captured by Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory antennas nevertheless provided such evidence. The text goes on to say that detailed statistical analysis confirmed the observation of gravitational waves with a high degree of confidence—that is, with near certainty—a finding that helped to preclude, or rule out, any claims that the signal’s attribution to gravitational waves might be ambiguous or doubtful. Choice A is incorrect. In this context, ""inconspicuousness"" would mean the quality of being unnoticeable or difficult to detect. Although the text indicates that skeptics had doubted whether gravitational waves could be observed directly because of their presumed faintness (which suggests that gravitational waves were expected to be difficult to detect), the blank portion of the text isn’t referring to the possibility that gravitational waves are unnoticeable or undetectable. Instead, the focus of the last sentence is González’s team’s observation of a chirping sound that they attributed to gravitational waves, and it wouldn’t make sense to say that through statistical analysis, they ruled out the possibility that the sound they observed was undetectable. Rather, the skeptical view presented in the text suggests that there could be some ambiguity about the source of the chirping, but statistical analysis virtually eliminated this uncertainty. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, ""discretion"" would mean good judgment, and it wouldn’t make sense to say that an event, such as the detection of gravitational waves, would show judgment, much less that the event’s capacity to exercise good judgment would be precluded by statistical analysis confirming its attribution. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, ""probability"" would mean likelihood, and the text states that statistical analysis, which confirmed the signal with a high degree of confidence, suggests the likelihood that the chirping sound was produced by gravitational waves, not that the analysis helped to preclude this likelihood."

Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to refer to the author’s claim as “disorienting,” or confusing. The text suggests that the author’s claim is insubstantial, not that it’s difficult to grasp. Choice C is incorrect because referring to the claim as “nuanced,” or subtle, wouldn’t make sense in context.

In the text, the narrator makes observations about her young niece, Dot, noting that Dot is making progress toward outgrowing babyhood and is growing stronger ""day by day."" The description of Dot purposefully exercising by ""bouncing for hours"" reinforces the narrator’s earlier characterization of Dot. The underlined sentence thus offers a detail that shows how Dot is growing stronger. Choice B is incorrect. While a sentence earlier in the text mentions Celestine’s psychological state (sadness because Dot is growing fast), the underlined sentence doesn’t focus on Celestine at all. Instead, the sentence focuses on Dot’s physical activities to show that she is getting stronger. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined sentence describes Dot’s behavior, not the narrator’s psychological characteristics. While a sentence earlier in the text establishes that the narrator, like Dot, was ""impatient with babyhood,"" the underlined sentence specifically addresses Dot’s physical activities in her stroller.

In this context, “latent” means dormant or functionless. The text sets up a contrast between the idea that baleen whale accessory spleens appear not to have a function and the research indicating that the accessory spleen may actually have a role in supporting the whales’ diving mechanisms. This context therefore conveys the idea that the assumption that baleen whale accessory spleens are latent may be incorrect. Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that the role of the accessory spleen is “replicable,” or capable of being reproduced. The text indicates that the role of the accessory spleen seems to have no function, but some researchers think it does have a role; the text doesn’t address whether the role of the accessory spleen could or couldn’t be reproduced. Choice B is incorrect because suggesting that the role of the accessory spleen is “predetermined,” or decided in advance, wouldn’t make sense in context. Although the researchers may agree that the role of the accessory spleen or any other organ hasn’t been determined in advance, the text focuses on the idea that the accessory spleen was thought to have been functionless but may in fact serve an active role for baleen whales.

As used in this context, “peripheral” means situated toward the outer bounds rather than the center. The text indicates that Xoconochco was located on a coast, hundreds of kilometers away from the capital of the Aztec Empire. The text also states that trade between the province and the capital required “a long overland journey.” This context suggests that Xoconochco was situated toward an edge of the empire’s territory rather than near its center. Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to refer to Xoconochco’s location within the Aztec Empire as “unobtrusive,” or not blatant or undesirably prominent; it’s not clear how a province’s physical location would or wouldn’t be blatant. Instead of focusing on how noticeable Xoconochco’s location was, the text emphasizes the province’s distance from the capital of the empire, pointing out that because of this distance trade between the two required “a long overland journey.” Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that the province of Xoconochco was located on a coast far from the capital of the Aztec Empire, not that it was “concealed,” or kept out of sight or hidden from view. Nothing in the text suggests that Xoconochco was actually hidden such that people couldn’t see it, and being hidden wouldn’t necessarily result in trade between the province and the capital requiring “a long overland journey.” Choice C is incorrect because to say that Xoconochco’s location within the Aztec Empire was “approximate” would mean that the location either wasn’t precisely correct or was close to some other location. Neither of these meanings would make sense in context because the text indicates that Xoconochco’s location is known and that it was far from the empire’s capital, so there’s no reason to characterize the location as either not precisely correct or close to another location."

In this context the word ""impending"" means imminent or approaching. The text mentions a study by Leka and colleagues that found that the Sun’s corona provides an advance indication of solar flares. The text then points out why such an advance indication would be useful—solar flares can interfere with communications on Earth—and concludes by describing the characteristic of the corona that gives warning of a solar flare. The text indicates that this characteristic—increased brightness in a particular region of the corona—comes before the appearance of the flare. Therefore, in context, the best answer would indicate that the flare is approaching, or impending. Choice A is incorrect. The best answer would be one that indicates that the increased brightness of the Sun’s corona precedes the appearance of the flare. But if the flare were ""antecedent,"" or previous, then the flare would instead precede the appearance of the increased brightness of the corona, a statement that is logically inconsistent. Choice C is incorrect. The word ""innocuous,"" or harmless, does not logically complete the text; since solar flares can interfere with communications on Earth, they cannot reasonably be described as innocuous. Choice D is incorrect. If the solar flares have an advance indication of their appearance, then there must therefore be a time before the appearance of the flares when they do not exist. But the word ""perpetual,"" or never-ending, would in context indicate that the flare exists at the same time as the advance indication provided by the Sun’s corona, which would not make logical sense."

The tools were found in a layer of earth that is over 33,000 years old—much older than the Clovis people’s arrival 13,000 years ago. The text ends with the claim that the tools reveal that humans lived in the cave long before the Clovis people reached the continent. Text 2, on the other hand, disputes the idea that the stone pieces are definitely tools. Text 2 states that the pieces are so roughly shaped that they may have simply naturally broken off from rocks and, moreover, that no other signs of human activity have been found in the cave. In other words, Text 2 argues that there is no proof yet that humans made the pieces as tools or were even present in the cave. Therefore, the author of Text 2 would most likely say that the claim that humans occupied Chiquihuite Cave long before the Clovis people reached North America rests on an assumption about the stone pieces—that they are human-made tools—that is not sufficiently supported by available evidence. Choice A is incorrect because Text 1 doesn’t claim that human inhabitants of Chiquihuite Cave and the Clovis people had any connection; the author of Text 1 focuses only on the timing of each group’s presence in North America. Further, the author of Text 2 makes no mention of the Clovis people and indicates that it isn’t clear yet that any human group did inhabit Chiquihuite Cave. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in Text 2 suggests that the author believes the stone pieces probably are human-made tools and will be confirmed as such by further analysis; instead, the author of Text 2 emphasizes the current lack of evidence of human activity in the cave. Choice D is incorrect because Text 2 focuses on the issue of characterizing the stone pieces as tools made by humans, not on the timing of any particular group’s activity in North America; further, Text 1 seems to support the common belief that the Clovis people reached North America 13,000 years ago and challenges only the idea that they were the continent’s first inhabitants. Therefore, there’s no reason to think the author of Text 2 would say that the author of Text 1 overlooks evidence that the Clovis people were active as early as is commonly thought."

In the text, the speaker mentions the occurrence in nature of seedpods being shaken by a slight wind. The speaker then goes on to compare the black seeds to thoughts, using language that indicates that the speaker’s state of mind is unsettled (e.g., ""my thoughts are spent""; ""My thoughts tear me, I dread their fever""). The text concludes with a comparison between the speaker’s ""scattered"" state of mind and the ""hot shrivelled seeds."" Thus, the underlined portion of the text presents an observation of an occurrence in the natural world that the speaker then expands on to convey a sense of a turbulent interior state. Choice A is incorrect because the text does not indicate that the seedpods are the cause of the speaker’s state of mind; thus, they could not be responsible for any misgivings the speaker has. Choice B is incorrect because the text does not contrast the natural landscape with the speaker’s state of mind or describe the wind shaking the seedpods as consistent; rather, the text suggests that the state of the natural world and the speaker’s state of mind are similar in that both are unsettled.

The text indicates that “people can take simple steps” to avoid bringing possible invasive species into new environments. It presents these steps as an example of how biodiversity loss due to invasive species is preventable. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that a simple step like washing your shoes after traveling is an example of biodiversity loss due to invasive species being “undeniable,” or something that can’t be proved to be wrong. Although the text may suggest that biodiversity loss due to invasive species is something that really happens, the word that completes the text must make the first sentence into an assertion that is illustrated by the second sentence, and the second sentence illustrates the idea that biodiversity loss due to invasive species is preventable, not undeniable.

Additionally, the text doesn’t provide any information about how frequently invasive species cause biodiversity loss. Choice D is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that a simple step like washing your shoes after traveling is an example of biodiversity loss due to invasive species being “concerning,” or something that is troubling or causes worry.

Text 1 begins by noting the success of The Nutcracker but then claims that the ballet is ""stuck in the past"" and should ""no longer be produced."" Text 2 begins by conceding that The Nutcracker is indeed outdated but argues that it should continue to be performed, states that the show can be updated to include more contemporary dance styles, and provides an example of one such modernized version, Hot Chocolate Nutcracker . Hence, the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1 by suggesting that dance companies should consider offering revised versions of The Nutcracker instead of completely rejecting the show. Choice A is incorrect because the author of Text 2 advocates for using creative ways to update The Nutcracker and therefore wouldn’t respond to the underlined claim by rejecting the suggestion that contemporary audiences would enjoy an updated version. Choice B is incorrect because although the authors of both texts claim that The Nutcracker is outdated, neither text suggests that contemporary audiences have largely stopped attending productions of the show. On the contrary, Text 2 states that The Nutcracker is a holiday favorite and generates substantial income for some dance companies.

To suggest that Dido is worried that Aeneas might discover a secret she is keeping from him,B,"Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text, which is to foreground Queen Dido’s strong emotional response to Aeneas’s story. Throughout, the text emphasizes how deeply the queen is affected by both Aeneas’s tale and persona. At the outset, the speaker explicitly states that ""anxious cares...seiz’d the queen"" and then uses the metaphor of fire (""within her veins a flame unseen"" and ""secret fire"") to evoke the warmth of Dido’s feelings for Aeneas. In addition, the line ""His words, his looks, imprinted in her heart"" suggests the deep impression that Aeneas’s story makes on Dido, eliciting passion for him (""improv[ing] the passion"") and empathy for his suffering (""increas[ing] the smart""). Choice A is incorrect because there’s no indication in the text that Dido is skeptical of Aeneas’s account, much less that she’s trying to conceal that skepticism. On the contrary, the text shows her being moved by his words and developing feelings for him. Choice C is incorrect. While the text mentions that Dido is impressed by Aeneas’s ""valor, acts, and birth,"" which might suggest (but doesn’t necessarily entail) intellectual engagement, the text doesn’t represent Dido’s engagement with Aeneas in a manner that suggests a balance between emotion and intellect. Rather, the text primarily emphasizes her emotional response—specifically her attraction to Aeneas and her emotional investment in his story, indicating that his ""valor, acts, and birth inspire / Her soul with love, and fan the secret fire"" and that his words and looks elicit passion and empathy. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that Dido is worried about Aeneas discovering a secret she is concealing from him. Though the text begins by mentioning Dido’s ""anxious cares,"" this refers to her growing passion for Aeneas and pity for his suffering, not to worry about a secret she is concealing. The text’s reference to a ""flame unseen"" and ""secret fire"" points to Dido’s growing feelings for Aeneas that develop as he recounts his tale, not to a secret that existed before their encounter; moreover, the text provides no indication that Dido is worried Aeneas might discover these feelings."

As the researchers fitted each magpie with a tracker attached by a small harness, they noticed some magpies without trackers pecking at another magpie’s tracker until it broke off. The researchers suggest that this behavior could be evidence of magpies attempting to help another magpie without benefiting themselves. Text 2 It can be tempting to think that animals are deliberately providing help when we see them removing trackers and other equipment from one another, especially when a species is known to exhibit other cooperative behaviors. At the same time, it can be difficult to exclude the possibility that individuals are simply interested in the equipment because of its novelty, curiously pawing or pecking at it until it detaches.","Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the researchers’ perspective in Text 1 on the behavior of the magpies without trackers?",A. That behavior might have been due to the novelty of the magpies’ captive setting rather than to the novelty of the tracker. | B. That behavior likely indicates that the magpies were deliberately attempting to benefit themselves by obtaining the tracker. | C. That behavior may not be evidence of selflessness in Gymnorhina tibicen because not all the captured magpies demonstrated it. | D. That behavior might be adequately explained without suggesting that the magpies were attempting to assist the other magpie.,D,"Choice D is the best answer because it reflects how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to the researchers’ perspective in Text 1 on the behavior of the magpies without trackers. According to Text 1, Dominique Potvin and colleagues observed magpies without trackers pecking at a tracker on another magpie until the device fell off. The researchers suggested that the birds might have been attempting to help the other bird, with no benefit to themselves. Text 2 generally discusses scenarios in which animals have been observed removing trackers from each other. The text cautions that it shouldn’t be assumed that these animals are helping one another deliberately, since they might simply be pecking at trackers out of curiosity, causing them to fall off eventually. Therefore, the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to Potvin and colleagues’ perspective in Text 1 by saying that the behavior of the magpies without trackers could be adequately explained without suggesting that they were attempting to assist the other magpie. Choice A is incorrect because Text 2 never discusses the novelty, or the newness and unusual quality, of the captive settings in which animals have been observed to remove trackers from other animals, nor does it suggest that such novelty might account for this behavior. Instead, the text suggests that it’s the novelty of the tracking equipment itself that might cause the behavior: interested in the trackers because they’re unusual, animals might paw or peck at them until they fall off. Choice B is incorrect because Text 2 never suggests that when animals remove trackers from other animals, they do so because they wish to obtain the trackers for themselves. Instead, Text 2 argues that animals paw or peck at trackers because they are merely curious about them. Choice C is incorrect because Text 2 doesn’t argue that when captured animals are observed removing trackers from each other, their behavior should be regarded as selfless only if all of them participate in it. Instead, the text argues that the behavior may not be selfless at all and may instead be attributed to animals’ curiosity about the new and unusual trackers."

Text 2 Monitoring carried out by researchers from the Norwegian Polar Institute shows that the polar bear population on the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard remains stable and well nourished despite rapidly declining sea ice in recent years.

Text 2 describes how the Svalbard polar bears have adapted to the loss of sea ice by diversifying their diet and feeding on reindeer and seabird eggs, resulting in a “stable and well nourished” population despite environmental challenges. This counters the underlined claim that polar bears facing a loss of sea ice are at “great risk of extinction” by the end of the century. Choice B is incorrect. Text 2 does not challenge the fact that sea ice is rapidly declining in the Arctic due to warming ocean temperatures. In fact, it states that the Svalbard polar bears have faced “rapidly declining sea ice in recent years.” Choice C is incorrect. The claim in Text 1 is specific to polar bear populations affected by the loss of seal hunting habitats, so unaffected populations are irrelevant to the claim. Also, Text 2 doesn’t mention any polar bear populations that haven’t yet been affected by loss of seal hunting habitats. It focuses on a population that has been affected by sea-ice loss but has managed to survive and thrive nevertheless. Choice D is incorrect.

As used in this context, “confined to” means restricted to. The text says that Velázquez was the leading artist in the Spanish court during the seventeenth century, but it also notes that other painters around the world were influenced by his techniques and style. Thus, Velázquez’s influence was hardly (or almost not) confined to, or restricted to, Spain. Choice A is incorrect because if Velázquez was a leading artist in Spain, it doesn’t make logical sense to claim that his influence was hardly (or almost not) derived from, or obtained from, Spain. Moreover, the other painters around the world who employed Velázquez’s techniques would by definition be influenced by Spanish style. Choice B is incorrect because if Velázquez was a leading artist in the court of King Philip IV of Spain, then his influence must have been widely recognized, or acknowledged, rather than being hardly (or almost not) recognized.

He completely loses his memory whenever he sleeps. So, before sleeping, Latro records the important experiences of each day on a scroll, carefully choosing which ones to ______ blank .",Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?,A. suspect | B. preserve | C. suggest | D. imagine,B,"Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text about Latro, the main character in Gene Wolfe’s novel Soldier of the Mist . In this context, ""preserve"" means save or keep from destruction or loss. The text describes Latro as a character who loses his memory whenever he sleeps. The text goes on to explain that before going to sleep, Latro records his most important memories to prevent him from forgetting, or losing, them. The context therefore supports the idea that Latro records his most important experiences in an effort to save, or preserve, his memory of them from loss. Choice A is incorrect because ""suspect"" would mean mistrust, which wouldn’t make sense in this context. The text emphasizes that in writing down his experiences, Latro carefully chooses those which are most important to him and thus worth remembering later, not that he is mistrustful or has reason to doubt the experiences he records. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, ""suggest"" would mean propose for consideration. The text emphasizes the fact that Latro actually records those experiences that he has decided are most important to him, not that he merely proposes which experiences to consider for inclusion in his scroll. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, ""imagine"" would either mean form a mental image of or fabricate, neither of which would logically complete the text. Although it’s possible that reviewing records from previous days might enable Latro to reconstruct mental images of what has happened to him in the past, the text emphasizes the fact that Latro carefully selects and writes down his experiences so he will remember them in the future, not so that he can form mental pictures of them as he writes them down. In a similar vein, the text emphasizes that Latro is recording experiences that have actually happened to him, not that he’s fabricating the experiences he records."

Amos Barton.” Mr. Ely is a clergyman in the town of Milby. By the laity of Milby and its neighbourhood [ Mr. Ely] was regarded as a man of quite remarkable powers and learning, who must make a considerable sensation in London pulpits and drawing-rooms on his occasional visit to the metropolis; and by his brother clergy he was regarded as a discreet and agreeable fellow. Mr. Ely never got into a warm discussion; he suggested what might be thought, but rarely said what he thought himself; he never let either men or women see that he was laughing at them, and he never gave any one an opportunity of laughing at him .",Which choice best describes the overall structure of the text?,A. It shows that Mr. Ely had originally been held in high regard by his friends and then details the events that caused their regard for him to subside. | B. It implies that Mr. Ely’s neighbors are more naïve in their estimation of him than people in London are and then explains why his neighbors have been so easily misled. | C. It stresses the discrepancy between Mr. Ely’s public and private conduct and then alludes to his motivation for hiding his true personality. | D. It presents the favorable opinion of Mr. Ely that other people hold and then describes the behaviors of Mr. Ely that enable him to maintain that favorable opinion.,D,"Choice D is the best answer because it best describes the overall structure of the text. The first part of the text presents the favorable opinions that others hold of Mr. Ely: the laity of Milby regard him as having ""remarkable powers and learning"" and assume that he also impresses people in London, while his fellow clergy see him as ""a discreet and agreeable fellow."" The text then goes on to describe Mr. Ely’s behaviors that enable him to cultivate and preserve his positive reputation. The text conveys that he avoids confrontations, abstaining from ""warm discussion[s]"" (that is, heated or contentious ones); that he avoids offending anyone by ""rarely [saying] what he thought himself"" and by refraining from openly ridiculing anyone; and that he doesn’t give anyone any reason to ridicule or belittle his own character (""he never gave any one an opportunity of laughing at him ""). In other words, these are all behaviors that suggest that Mr. Ely avoids doing anything that might make people dislike him or think poorly of him. Thus, the text begins by presenting the favorable view that people have of Mr. Ely and then describes the behaviors that enable him to maintain that favorable view. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t describe any events that caused people’s regard for Mr. Ely to diminish. Instead, the text explains that the people of Milby hold him in high regard and describes behaviors that suggest how he cultivates that regard. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that Mr. Ely’s neighbors are more naïve than Londoners are or that they’ve been misled. Although the text suggests that Mr. Ely is very guarded in his outward behavior and conceals from people when he may be internally mocking them, which might suggest that people know him less well than they think they do, there’s nothing in the text to suggest that Londoners are less naïve and therefore less easily misled than Mr. Ely’s neighbors are. The text states that the people of Milby believe Mr. Ely to be ""remarkable"" and that they assume that people in London must find him so, too; it doesn’t say anything about what Londoners actually think of him. Choice C is incorrect. While the text discusses Mr. Ely’s public conduct at length, describing the ways in which he carefully cultivates an agreeable public persona, the text doesn’t discuss how Mr. Ely behaves in private at all; it therefore wouldn’t be accurate to say that the text begins by emphasizing a discrepancy between his public and private conduct. Furthermore, although the text concludes with examples illustrating that Mr. Ely typically doesn’t share his true thoughts, indicating that he may be hiding aspects of his true personality when in public, and although the text as a whole conveys the idea that Mr. Ely benefits from this behavior, which might hint at his motives for doing so, the text doesn’t conclude by alluding to those motives. Instead, the text merely concludes with a description of the behaviors he engages in to win his neighbors’ and colleagues’ approval."

Identified | B. Combined | C. Remembered | D. Celebrated,B,"Choice B is the best answer because as used in the text, ""mingled"" most nearly means combined. In the text, the speaker refers to several concepts mingling together and then compares this to ""the blending of"" two other things (an exotic plant and the fragrance of a strange flower). This comparison conveys that the speaker views the concepts of love, April, and the gold of someone’s hair as being blended together, or combined. Choice A is incorrect because ""mingled"" means combined, not identified. The speaker names several concepts (love, April, and the gold color of someone’s hair) and then moves to a comparison of their mingling together to ""the blending of"" a plant and the scent of a flower, conveying the idea that the speaker views the concepts as blended together, or combined. Choice C is incorrect. The text as a whole may refer to a memory, but the comparison of the mingling of several concepts (love, April, and the gold color of someone’s hair) to ""the blending of"" a plant and the scent of a flower conveys that the speaker views those concepts as actually blended together, or combined, and not simply remembered at the same time. Choice D is incorrect. The speaker refers to several concepts (love, April, and the gold color of someone’s hair) and then compares the mingling together of those concepts to ""the blending of"" a plant and the scent of a flower; rather than suggesting that the concepts are celebrated, this comparison conveys that the speaker views the concepts as blended together, or combined."

The narrator is a young girl living in Pittsburgh. I walked. My mother had given me the freedom of the streets as soon as I could say our telephone number. I walked and memorized the neighborhood. I made a mental map and located myself upon it. At night in bed I rehearsed the small world’s scheme and set challenges: Find the store using backyards only.

It describes the narrator trying to memorize her telephone number. | B. It provides examples of what the narrator thinks about at night. | C. It gives directions to the narrator’s favorite local store. | D. It portrays the narrator’s relationship with her mother.,B,"Choice B is the best answer because it accurately describes how the underlined portion functions in the text as a whole. In the text, the narrator explains that she walks around her neighborhood, making a ""mental map"" of the area that she imagines herself navigating through. She then states that she rehearses ""the small world’s scheme""—that is, imagines moving through her mental map—and challenges herself to use the map in her mind while lying in bed at night. The underlined portion presents two such challenges (getting to the store through backyards and traveling from school to a friend’s house) and thus provides examples of what the narrator thinks about at night. Choice A is incorrect because the underlined portion makes no mention of memorizing a telephone number. Although the narrator mentions that she had to learn the home telephone number before her mother would give her permission to walk around the neighborhood, there is nothing in the underlined portion or the rest of the text about memorizing the telephone number. Choice C is incorrect. Although the underlined portion refers to navigation tasks like finding a route to a store only through backyards, the text contains no specific directions to any store, nor is any store identified as the narrator’s favorite. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined portion makes no mention of the narrator’s mother and doesn’t address the narrator’s relationship with her. Although the narrator mentions that her mother gave her permission as a child to walk around the neighborhood, there is nothing in the underlined portion or the rest of the text about the mother or her relationship to her child."

In this context, “negligible” means not significant enough to be worth considering. The text says that the study challenged the accepted view of female participation in hunting among prehistoric peoples. The text goes on to say that the researchers found that “in fact, as many as half” the hunters in the groups studied were female. The phrase “in fact” establishes a contrast indicating that the finding that as many as half the hunters were female differs from the accepted view. This context suggests, then, that the accepted view is that female participation in hunting was negligible. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that the study challenged the accepted view by showing that as many as half of hunters among prehistoric peoples were female, which suggests that the accepted view is that female participation was low, not that female participation was “inevitable,” or unavoidable. Nothing in the text suggests that the accepted view is that prehistoric peoples could not avoid female participation in hunting. Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the accepted view of female participation in hunting among prehistoric peoples is that such participation was “satisfactory,” or sufficient to meet a requirement or demand. There is no information in the text about any demands or requirements regarding female participation in hunting, let alone any information about how much female participation in hunting would be enough to satisfy those demands or requirements. Instead, the text indicates that the study challenged the accepted view by showing that as many as half the hunters in the groups studied were female, suggesting that the accepted view is that female participation in hunting was low. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that the study challenged the accepted view by showing that as many as half of hunters among the prehistoric peoples studied were female, which suggests that the accepted view is that female participation was low, not that female participation was “commonplace,” or ordinary or unremarkable. Although the study under discussion suggests that female participation may have been commonplace, that study is presented as challenging the accepted view, not as reinforcing the accepted view."

In this context “adhere to” would mean to act in accordance with. The text states that although members of the Igun Eronmwon guild typically do something with techniques that have been passed down since the thirteenth century, they “don’t strictly observe every tradition.” By establishing a contrast with not always following traditions, the context suggests that guild members do typically adhere to traditional techniques. Choice A is incorrect because in this context “experiment with” would mean to do something new with. Although using motors rather than manual bellows is presented as a new approach, the text establishes a contrast between what the guild members typically do with techniques that have been passed down over centuries and the idea that the members “don’t strictly observe every tradition.” The phrase “experiment with” wouldn’t support the contrast because regularly trying new things with the techniques would be an example of not strictly following all traditions. Choice C is incorrect because in this context “improve on” would mean to make better. Although using motors rather than manual bellows might be an improved approach, the text establishes a contrast between what the guild members typically do with techniques that have been passed down over centuries and the idea that the members “don’t strictly observe every tradition.” The phrase “improve on” wouldn’t support the contrast because regularly making changes to the techniques would be an example of not strictly following all traditions. Choice D is incorrect because in this context “grapple with” would mean to try hard to solve a difficult problem. Although bronze- and brass-casting are likely challenging tasks, nothing in the text suggests that the guild members have any particular difficulties with the techniques passed down since the thirteenth century."

In this context, ""distinct"" means clearly separate and different. The text indicates that the novel consists of three sections and that each section is narrated from the perspective of a different character. This context supports the idea that Kim’s novel features three distinct perspectives. Choice B is incorrect because describing the three perspectives in Kim’s novel as ""required,"" or demanded as necessary to be done or provided, wouldn’t make sense in context. When writing a novel, a novelist is free to choose to narrate the story from any number of perspectives. There’s nothing in the text to indicate that providing three perspectives was demanded of Kim. Instead, the text focuses on identifying the three different perspectives featured in Kim’s novel. Choice C is incorrect because describing the three perspectives in Kim’s novel as ""unintended,"" or not planned as a purpose or goal, wouldn’t make sense in context. Authors make deliberate choices about the perspectives they feature in their works, and the text indicates that Kim chose to incorporate three different perspectives in her novel. Choice D is incorrect because describing the three perspectives in Kim’s novel as ""unknown,"" or not revealed, wouldn’t make sense in context. The text directly identifies the three perspectives that appear in her novel as those of Faye and her two parents, Haesu and Chun, which indicates that the novel’s perspectives are in fact known."

So the transition ""by contrast"" fits the context perfectly. Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates a restatement of the same idea in different words. But this sentence doesn’t restate the same idea as the previous sentence. Instead, it makes a new point about a different type of molecule (chiral instead of achiral). Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that introduces an example, which doesn’t make sense here. The second sentence isn’t an example of the first sentence’s claim about achiral molecules: it actually introduces an entirely different idea that focuses on chiral molecules. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates the addition of an agreeing idea. But this sentence shows a contrast with the first sentence—namely, that a chiral molecule acts very differently from an achiral molecule when flipped."

Noting that the evidence suggests Indigenous peoples may have found dinosaur remains in 1100 CE, the sentence emphasizes how the 1990 discovery challenged Plot’s reputation as the first person to discover dinosaur remains. Choice A is incorrect. While the sentence does emphasize that Benoit challenged Plot’s reputation, it misrepresents information in the notes; Plot was reputed to be the first person to discover dinosaur remains in general, not the first person to discover M. carinatus remains specifically. Choice C is incorrect. The sentence only partially explains the significance of the 1990 discovery, noting that it suggests Indigenous people brought dinosaur remains to the cave in 1100 CE; it doesn’t explain the discovery’s significance to Plot’s reputation. Choice D is incorrect. While the sentence does emphasize that the discovery challenged Plot’s reputation, it misrepresents information in the notes. The notes don’t indicate that the 1990 discovery cast any doubt on Plot’s claims to have found fossilized dinosaur bones; rather, the discovery challenged Plot’s reputation for being the first to discover dinosaur bones."

The sentence presents both findings from the study, noting that FTWs using marigolds both removed phosphorus from the water and yielded market-quality blooms. Choice A is incorrect. While the sentence presents a finding from the study, the presentation is incomplete; the study found that marigolds cultivated on FTWs both removed phosphorus from the water and yielded market-quality blooms. Choice B is incorrect. The sentence misrepresents information in the notes. The figure of 52% refers to the amount of phosphorus removed by FTWs using marigolds when compared to the control; the marigolds’ bloom yield was 65 market-quality blooms per square meter, and it was not compared to the control. Choice D is incorrect. The sentence misrepresents information in the notes. The FTWs using marigolds removed 52% more phosphorus from the water than did the control, not 52% of the total phosphorus.

Choice A is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. Without a conjunction following it, a comma can’t be used in this way to join two main clauses. Choice B is incorrect because when coordinating two longer main clauses such as these, it’s conventional to use a comma before the coordinating conjunction. Choice C is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentence. The two main clauses are fused without punctuation and/or a conjunction."

The convention being tested is subject-modifier placement. This choice makes the noun phrase ""the researchers"" the subject of the sentence and places it immediately after the modifying phrase ""knowing…day."" In doing so, this choice clearly establishes that the researchers—and not another noun in the sentence—know that flying insects keep their backs pointed toward sunlight during the day. Choice B is incorrect because it results in a dangling modifier. The placement of the noun phrase ""the researchers’ theory"" immediately after the modifying phrase illogically suggests that the researchers’ theory knows that flying insects keep their backs pointed toward sunlight during the day.

In this choice, the period is used correctly to mark the boundary between one sentence (“Defying…fast”) and another sentence that begins with a supplementary phrase (“During…Olympics”). Choice A is incorrect. When a dash is present in a sentence (“ran—fast”), it’s not conventional to use another dash (“fast—during”) to mark the boundary between sentences because it creates a potentially confusing sentence. In this context, a period, semicolon, or colon would be clear and more conventional. Choice B is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentence.

Further, placing the semicolon after ""though"" indicates that the information in the preceding main clause (interpretations of an outer solar system object’s composition based on its color are ultimately speculative) is a qualification of the information in the previous sentence (the composition of an outer solar system object is suggested by its color). Choice A is incorrect because it fails to mark the boundary between the two main clauses with appropriate punctuation.

Choice A is incorrect because the future tense verb “will reach” is inconsistent with the present tense verbs used to describe how atoms move through the synchrotron. Though the atoms’ movement is a recurring action and “will reach” can also be used to indicate a habitual or recurring action, it creates a logical inconsistency in this sentence when paired with the present tense verbs “travel” and “are diverted.” Choice C is incorrect because the past perfect tense verb “had reached” is inconsistent with the present tense verbs used to describe how atoms move through the synchrotron.

Further, the comma after ""trash"" correctly separates the noun phrase ""man-made trash"" from the supplementary phrase (""such as plastic bags"") that describes it.

The convention being tested is the use of finite and nonfinite verb forms within a sentence. The nonfinite to-infinitive “to tell” is correctly used to form a nonfinite (infinitive) clause that explains the reason Engle uses poetry in her novel.

The convention being tested is subject-modifier placement. This choice makes the noun phrase “many critics” the subject of the sentence and places it immediately after the modifying phrase “in assessing…Kurosawa.” In doing so, this choice clearly establishes that it is the critics—and not another noun in the sentence—who assess Kurosawa’s films. Choice B is incorrect because it results in a dangling modifier.

The convention being tested is the use of a colon within a sentence. In this choice, the colon is used in a conventional way to introduce the following description of how the number of jams available varied. Choice B is incorrect because it creates a comma splice. A comma can’t be used in this way to join two main clauses (“the number…varied” and “some…six”). Choice C is incorrect because it results in an illogical and confusing sentence. Using the conjunction “while” to join the main clause (“the number…varied”) with the following clause’s description of the number of jams available suggests that the variation in the number of jams is in contrast to some shoppers having twenty-four options.

The convention being tested is subject-modifier placement. This choice makes the proper noun ""Matthew Henson"" the subject of the sentence and places it immediately after the modifying phrase ""one…century."" In doing so, this choice clearly establishes that Matthew Henson—and not another noun in the sentence—is being described as one of the few African American global explorers during the turn of the 20th century. Choice B is incorrect because it results in a dangling modifier. The placement of the noun phrase ""1891 and 1909"" immediately after the modifying phrase illogically suggests that those years were one of the few African American global explorers during the turn of the 20th century. Choice C is incorrect because it results in a dangling modifier.

The convention being tested is the use of verbs to express tense. In this choice, the simple past tense verb “suggested” properly indicates that Zufall offered her suggestion for the product’s name in the past. This verb tense is consistent with the previous sentence’s use of a simple past tense verb (“advised”) to describe Zufall’s advice to McVicker in the 1950s. Choice B is incorrect because the present tense verb “suggests” doesn’t indicate that Zufall offered her suggestion in the past. Choice C is incorrect because the past perfect verb “had suggested” isn’t consistent with the previous sentence’s use of the simple past tense verb “advised” to describe Zufall’s advice to McVicker.

In this choice, the period is used correctly to mark the boundary between the first sentence (“On…temperature”) and the second sentence (“Adding…effect”). The gerund phrase beginning with “adding” is the subject of the second sentence, and the verb phrase “helps combat this effect” describes what adding a light-colored covering can do. Choice A is incorrect because a semicolon can’t be used in this way to join the sentence “On...temperature” and the supplementary phrases that follow. Doing so leaves the verb phrase “helps combat” without a subject and thus results in a grammatically unconventional sentence. Choice B is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. A comma can’t be used in this way to mark the boundary between sentences. Choice D is incorrect. This choice results in a confusing and illogical sentence that suggests that adding a light-colored covering to an existing dark roof raises the temperature of the surrounding air.

The convention being tested is the coordination of independent clauses within a sentence. An independent clause is a phrase containing a subject and a verb that can stand on its own as a sentence. This choice uses a comma and the coordinating conjunction “but” to join the first independent clause (“underlines…lower a book’s value”) and the second independent clause (“such markings…can be a gold mine to scholars”) to create a compound sentence. Choice B is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentence. The two independent clauses are fused without punctuation and/or a conjunction.

This choice correctly uses a comma to separate the supplementary adverb ""though"" from the preceding main clause (""Economists…conservation"") and uses a semicolon to join the next main clause (""efficiency gains…rises"") to the rest of the sentence. Further, placing the semicolon after ""though"" indicates that the information in the preceding main clause (""improvements in efficiency often correlate negatively with resource conservation"") is contrary to what might be assumed from the information in the previous sentence (resource consumption would be expected to decrease with the development of new, more efficient technologies).

This choice correctly uses commas to set off the nonessential relative clause ""which is known as Brownian motion"" that provides extra information about the ""random, continuous movement"" that isn’t necessary for the function of the sentence. Choice A is incorrect. This choice results in a punctuation error. The relative clause ""which is known as Brownian motion"" is a nonessential supplement. Nonessential supplements need to be set apart from the rest of the sentence with a pair of commas, dashes, or parentheses, so we can’t use a colon here. Also, notice that colons can only come after an independent clause, which isn’t the case here. Choice C is incorrect. This choice results in a punctuation error. The relative clause ""which is known as Brownian motion"" is a nonessential supplement, so it should be separated from the rest of the sentence by a pair of matching punctuation marks. We already have a comma after ""motion,"" so we need to add a comma before ""which."" This choice is missing that comma. Choice D is incorrect. This choice results in a sentence fragment.

A main clause requires a finite verb to perform the action of the subject (in this case, “a recent study”), and this choice supplies the finite present tense verb “explains” to indicate that the study explains why plants that attract bats have evolved to produce moderately sweet nectar. Choice B is incorrect because the nonfinite participle “explaining” doesn’t supply the main clause with a finite verb. Choice C is incorrect because the nonfinite participle “having explained” doesn’t supply the main clause with a finite verb.

Though, | D. equations though",A,"Choice A is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of punctuation to mark boundaries between supplements and clauses. The comma after “equations” is used to separate the independent clause (“Hopper’s…equation”) from the supplementary adverb phrase “though.” The colon after “though” is used to mark the boundary between the clause ending with “though” and the following clause (“as…age”). A colon used in this way introduces information that illustrates or explains information that has come before it. In this case, the colon after “though” introduces the following explanation of how Hopper’s subsequent career would involve more than just solving equations: she would become a pioneering computer programmer. Choice B is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. A comma can’t be used in this way to join two independent clauses (“Hopper’s…though” and “as…age”) such as these. Choice C is incorrect because it results in an illogical sequence of sentences. Placing the period after “equations” and beginning the next sentence with “Though” illogically suggests that the following information (that Hopper would help usher in the digital age) is contrary to the information in the previous sentence (Hopper’s subsequent career would involve more than just solving equations). Instead, the information that follows supports the information from the previous sentence by explaining how her work and influence extended beyond solely solving equations. Choice D is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentence. The two independent clauses (“Hopper’s…though” and “as…age”) are fused without punctuation."

The past tense of ""suspended"" matches the past tense of ""applied,"" which has the same subject (""he"") and takes place in the same context: ""He applied…and [he] suspended."" Choice A is incorrect. The perfect infinitive ""to have suspended"" doesn’t match the past tense of ""applied,"" and it can’t serve as a verb on its own. These are both verbs with the same subject and in the same context, so there’s no need to shift tenses. Choice B is incorrect. The present participle ""suspending"" doesn’t match the past tense of ""applied,"" and it can’t serve as a verb on its own. These are both verbs with the same subject and in the same context, so there’s no need to shift tenses. Choice C is incorrect.

The convention being tested is the use of punctuation within a sentence. The comma after ""work"" pairs with the comma after ""though"" to separate the supplementary element ""though"" from the rest of the sentence. This supplementary element signals that what follows is an exception to Chen using software tools to create illustrations, and the pair of commas indicates that this element could be removed without affecting the grammatical coherence of the sentence. Choice B is incorrect because the comma after ""work"" must be paired with a comma after ""though"" to separate the supplementary element from the rest of the sentence.

The convention being tested is punctuation between a supplementary phrase and a main clause. This choice correctly uses a comma to mark the boundary between the supplementary phrase (“A conceptual artist…world”), which describes Mary Ping, and the main clause (“Mary…America”). Choice A is incorrect because it fails to mark the boundary between the supplementary phrase (“A conceptual artist…world”) and the main clause (“Mary…America”) with appropriate punctuation. Choice B is incorrect because a colon can’t be used in this way to join the supplementary phrase (“A conceptual artist…world”) and the main clause (“Mary…America”). In this context, the colon incorrectly suggests that the information in the supplementary phrase is an explanation or amplification of the information in the main clause (Mary Ping being chosen to curate the exhibition), which isn’t the case.

Nothing belongs to the “poems” in the sentence, so it should not be possessive—just a simple plural noun.

Misaka served in World War II before he joined the New York Knicks in 1947. To show that a past occurrence took place before another past occurrence, we need to use “had” + the past tense form of the verb. This is called the past perfect tense. Choice A is incorrect. Misaka served in World War II before he joined the Knicks. Both events are in the past, but his service in World War II happened earlier, so we need a verb that makes it clear that his service (and the two national championships) had ended by the time he joined the Knicks.

Misaka served in World War II before he joined the Knicks. Both events are in the past, but they’re not happening at the same time, so we shouldn’t use the continuous past tense here.

Choice A is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. Without a coordinating conjunction, a comma can’t be used in this way to join the two main clauses (""The measurement…moved"" and ""for example…second""). Choice B is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. Without a conjunction following it, a comma can’t be used in this way to join the two main clauses (""The measurement…moved"" and ""one unit…second"").

Furthermore, placing commas around the phrase “by solar panels” suggests that it could be removed without affecting the coherence of the sentence, which isn’t the case. Choice B is incorrect because it fails to mark the boundary between the supplementary phrase and the main clause with appropriate punctuation. Choice D is incorrect. Placing commas around the phrase “collected by solar panels during the day″ suggests that it could be removed without affecting the coherence of the sentence, which isn’t the case."

C. vulgaris might be used, for example, to build future biological air exchange systems that ______ blank oxygen for astronauts.",Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?,A. are producing | B. produced | C. produce | D. have produced,C,"Choice C is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of verbs to express tense. Simple present tense verbs can be used to describe actions that tend to occur, including in a hypothetical or future scenario. In this case, the simple present tense verb “produce” indicates what the air exchange systems might be able to do in the future (produce oxygen for astronauts). Choice A is incorrect. The present progressive tense verb “are producing” suggests that the oxygen is currently being produced, not that it might be produced in the future. Choice B is incorrect because the past tense verb “produced” suggests that the oxygen was produced in the past, not that it might be produced in the future. Choice D is incorrect because the present perfect tense verb “have produced” suggests that the oxygen has been produced from a point in the past up to the present, not that it might be produced in the future."

The convention being tested is colon use within a sentence. A colon used in this way introduces information that illustrates or explains information that has come before it. In this case, the colon introduces the following explanation of why some roundworms in the Southern Hemisphere move in the opposite direction of Earth’s magnetic field. Choice B is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. A comma can’t be used in this way to join two long independent clauses (“Researchers…food” and “in…sources”) such as these. Choice C is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentence. The two clauses (“Researchers…food” and “in…sources”) are fused without punctuation. Furthermore, the conjunction “while” fails to indicate that what follows is an explanation of why some roundworms in the Southern Hemisphere move in the opposite direction of Earth’s magnetic field. Choice D is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentence. The two clauses (“Researchers…food” and “in…sources”) are fused without punctuation and/or a conjunction."

The convention being tested is pronoun-antecedent agreement. The singular pronoun ""it"" agrees in number with the singular antecedent ""the Salt Lake Temple."" Choice B is incorrect because the singular pronoun ""one"" is ambiguous in this context; the resulting sentence leaves unclear whether there is only one Salt Lake temple or multiple. Choice C is incorrect because the plural pronoun ""they"" doesn’t agree in number with the singular antecedent ""the Salt Lake Temple.""

The convention being tested is punctuation between a main clause and a supplementary noun phrase. This choice correctly uses a comma to mark the boundary between the main clause (“scholar…materialism”) and the supplementary noun phrase (“an apt assessment”) that describes Waid’s observation about how The House of Mirth depicts the upper classes of New York society. Choice A is incorrect because a semicolon and the conjunction “and” can’t be used in this way to mark the boundary between a main clause and a supplementary noun phrase. Choice B is incorrect. Joining the main clause (“scholar…materialism”) and the following noun phrase with the conjunction “and” results in a confusing and illogical sentence that suggests that the novel depicts the upper classes of New York society as “an apt assessment,” which doesn’t make sense in this context. Choice D is incorrect because it fails to mark the boundary between the main clause and the supplementary noun phrase with appropriate punctuation."

The subject of the verb is “Lincoln,” and the first sentence tells us that we’re talking about something that Abraham Lincoln did in 1860. So the simple past tense “leveraged” fits the logic of the text. Choice A is incorrect. This choice creates a tense issue. “Has leveraged” is the present perfect tense, which is used for an action that began in the past and continues into the present. Lincoln started leveraging his rivals’ talents in 1860—it’s definitely not still happening today. So the present perfect tense isn’t appropriate. Choice B is incorrect. This choice creates a tense issue. “Is leveraging” is the present tense, but Lincoln leveraged his rivals’ talents in 1860, so the present tense isn’t appropriate. Choice C is incorrect. This choice creates a tense issue. “Will leverage” is the future tense, but Lincoln leveraged his rivals’ talents in 1860, so the future tense isn’t appropriate."

Basic, in 2009, an online television network,",C,"Choice C is the best answer. The convention being tested is the punctuation of items in a complex series. It’s conventional to use a semicolon to separate items in a complex series with internal punctuation, and in this choice, the semicolon after “2009” is conventionally used to separate the first item (“the world’s…2009”) and the second item (“an online…2010”) in the series of things that Hinson helped create. Further, the comma after “Basic” correctly pairs with the comma after “app,” and the comma after “network” correctly pairs with the comma after “TV” to set off the supplemental elements (“Chickasaw Basic” and “Chickasaw TV”) that provide the names of the app and the TV network, respectively. Altogether, the punctuation in this choice results in a sentence that clearly indicates that Hinson helped make a language app in 2009, an online TV network in 2010, and a language course in 2015. Choice A is incorrect because it fails to punctuate the complex series in a way that makes clear that Hinson helped make a language app in 2009, an online TV network in 2010, and a language course in 2015. Choice B is incorrect because it fails to punctuate the complex series in a way that makes clear that Hinson helped make a language app in 2009, an online TV network in 2010, and a language course in 2015. Choice D is incorrect because the comma after “2009” doesn’t match the semicolon used to separate the second and third items in the complex series."

The convention being tested is the use of punctuation within a sentence. This choice correctly uses a comma to mark the boundary between the introductory participial phrase (""Hoping…classroom"") and the main clause (""Huerta…farmworkers"").
