The second equation in the given system is one half x plus three halves equals p y plus nine halves . Multiplying each side of this equation by 2 yields x plus 3 equals 2 p y plus 9 . Subtracting 2 p y from each side of this equation yields x plus 3 minus 2 p y equals 9 . Subtracting 3 from each side of this equation yields x minus 2 p y equals 6 . Therefore, the two equations in the given system, written in standard form, are minus 3 x plus 36 y equals 8 and x minus 2 p y equals 6 . As previously stated, if this system has no solution, the lines represented by the equations in the xy -plane are parallel and distinct, meaning the proportion StartFraction 1 Over negative 3 EndFraction equals StartFraction minus 2 p Over 36 EndFraction , or negative one third equals minus StartFraction p Over 18 EndFraction , is true and the proportion six eighths equals StartFraction 1 Over negative 3 EndFraction is not true. The proportion six eighths equals StartFraction 1 Over negative 3 EndFraction is not true. Multiplying each side of the true proportion, negative one third equals minus StartFraction p Over 18 EndFraction , by negative 18 yields 6 equals p . Therefore, if the system has no solution, then the value of p is 6 ."

Let x represent the number of children in a whale-watching tour group. Let y represent the number of adults in this group. Because it's given that 21 people are in a group and the group consists of adults and children, it must be true that x plus y equals 21 . Since the company's revenue is 60 dollars per child, the total revenue from x children in this group was 60 x dollars. Since the company's revenue is 80 dollars per adult, the total revenue from y adults in this group was 80 y dollars. Because it's given that the total revenue for this group was 1,440 dollars, it must be true that 60 x plus 80 y equals 1,440 .

Let s represent the number of small candles the owner can purchase, and let script l represent the number of large candles the owner can purchase. It’s given that the owner pays dollar sign 4.90 per candle to purchase small candles and dollar sign 11.60 per candle to purchase large candles. Therefore, the owner pays 4.90 s dollars for s small candles and 11.60 script l dollars for script l large candles, which means the owner pays a total of 4.90 s plus 11.60 script l dollars to purchase candles. It’s given that the owner budgets dollar sign 2,200 to purchase candles. Therefore, 4.90 s plus 11.60 script l less than or equals 2,200 . It’s also given that the owner must purchase a minimum of 200 candles. Therefore, s plus script l greater than or equals 200 . The inequalities 4.90 s plus 11.60 script l less than or equals 2,200 and s plus script l greater than or equals 200 can be combined into one compound inequality by rewriting the second inequality so that its left-hand side is equivalent to the left-hand side of the first inequality. Subtracting script l from both sides of the inequality s plus script l greater than or equals 200 yields s greater than or equals 200 minus script l .

This inequality can be combined with the inequality 4.90 s plus 11.60 script l less than or equals 2,200 , which yields the compound inequality 980 plus 6.70 script l less than or equals 4.90 s plus 11.60 script l less than or equals 2,200 . It follows that 980 plus 6.70 script l less than or equals 2,200 . Subtracting 980 from both sides of this inequality yields 6.70 script l less than or equals 2,200 . Dividing both sides of this inequality by 6.70 yields approximately script l less than or equals 182.09 . Since the number of large candles the owner purchases must be a whole number, the maximum number of large candles the owner can purchase is the largest whole number less than 182.09 , which is 182 ."

Substituting 0 for x in the equation defining function f yields f left parenthesis 0 right parenthesis equals a left parenthesis 2.2 Superscript 0 Baseline plus 2.2 Superscript b Baseline right parenthesis , or f left parenthesis 0 right parenthesis equals a left parenthesis 1 plus 2.2 Superscript b Baseline right parenthesis . So, the y -coordinate of the y -intercept of the graph is a left parenthesis 1 plus 2.2 Superscript b Baseline right parenthesis , or equivalently, a plus a left parenthesis 2.2 right parenthesis Superscript b . It's given that function g is equivalent to function f , where 0 less than a less than b . It follows that k equals 2.2 Superscript b . Since a left parenthesis 2.2 right parenthesis Superscript b can't be equal to 0 , the coefficient a can't be equal to a plus a left parenthesis 2.2 right parenthesis Superscript b . Since 0 less than a , the constant k , which is equal to 2.2 Superscript b , can't be equal to a plus a left parenthesis 2.2 right parenthesis Superscript b . Therefore, function g doesn't display the y -coordinate of the y -intercept of the graph of y equals f left parenthesis x right parenthesis in the xy -plane as a constant or coefficient. It's also given that function h is equivalent to function f , where 0 less than a less than b . The equation defining f can be rewritten as f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals a left parenthesis 2.2 right parenthesis Superscript x Baseline plus a left parenthesis 2.2 right parenthesis Superscript b . It follows that m equals a left parenthesis 2.2 right parenthesis Superscript b . Since a left parenthesis 2.2 right parenthesis Superscript b can't be equal to 0 , the coefficient a can't be equal to a plus a left parenthesis 2.2 right parenthesis Superscript b . Since 0 less than a , the constant m , which is equal to a left parenthesis 2.2 right parenthesis Superscript b , can't be equal to a plus a left parenthesis 2.2 right parenthesis Superscript b . Therefore, function h doesn't display the y -coordinate of the y -intercept of the graph of y equals f left parenthesis x right parenthesis in the xy -plane as a constant or coefficient. Thus, neither function g nor function h displays the y -coordinate of the y -intercept of the graph of y equals f left parenthesis x right parenthesis in the xy -plane as a constant or coefficient.

Squaring both sides of this equation yields k minus x equals left parenthesis 58 minus x right parenthesis squared , which is equivalent to the given equation if 58 minus x greater than 0 . It follows that if a solution to the equation k minus x equals left parenthesis 58 minus x right parenthesis squared satisfies 58 minus x greater than 0 , then it's also a solution to the given equation; if not, it's extraneous. The equation k minus x equals left parenthesis 58 minus x right parenthesis squared can be rewritten as k minus x equals 3,364 minus 116 x plus x squared .

The model estimates that the projectile was launched from an initial height of 7 meters above the ground and reached a maximum height of 51.1 meters above the ground 3 seconds after the launch. How many seconds after the launch does the model estimate that the projectile will return to a height of 7 meters?",,B,A. 3 | B. 6 | C. 7 | D. 9,"Choice B is correct. It's given that a quadratic function models the projectile's height, in meters, above the ground in terms of the time, in seconds, after it was launched. It follows that an equation representing the model can be written in the form f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals a left parenthesis x minus h right parenthesis squared plus k , where f left parenthesis x right parenthesis is the projectile's estimated height above the ground, in meters, x seconds after the launch, a is a constant, and k is the maximum height above the ground, in meters, the model estimates the projectile reached h seconds after the launch. It's given that the model estimates the projectile reached a maximum height of 51.1 meters above the ground 3 seconds after the launch. Therefore, k equals 51.1 and h equals 3 . Substituting 51.1 for k and 3 for h in the equation f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals a left parenthesis x minus h right parenthesis squared plus k yields f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals a left parenthesis x minus 3 right parenthesis squared plus 51.1 . It's also given that the model estimates that the projectile was launched from an initial height of 7 meters above the ground. Therefore, when x equals 0 , f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals 7 . Substituting 0 for x and 7 for f left parenthesis x right parenthesis in the equation f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals a left parenthesis x minus 3 right parenthesis squared plus 51.1 yields 7 equals a left parenthesis 0 minus 3 right parenthesis squared plus 51.1 , or 7 equals 9 a plus 51.1 . Subtracting 51.1 from both sides of this equation yields negative 44.1 equals 9 a . Dividing both sides of this equation by 9 yields negative 4.9 equals a . Substituting negative 4.9 for a in the equation f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals a left parenthesis x minus 3 right parenthesis squared plus 51.1 yields f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals minus 4.9 left parenthesis x minus 3 right parenthesis squared plus 51.1 . Therefore, the equation f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals minus 4.9 left parenthesis x minus 3 right parenthesis squared plus 51.1 models the projectile's height, in meters, above the ground x seconds after it was launched. The number of seconds after the launch that the model estimates that the projectile will return to a height of 7 meters is the value of x when f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals 7 . Substituting 7 for f left parenthesis x right parenthesis in f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals minus 4.9 left parenthesis x minus 3 right parenthesis squared plus 51.1 yields 7 equals minus 4.9 left parenthesis x minus 3 right parenthesis squared plus 51.1 . Subtracting 51.1 from both sides of this equation yields negative 44.1 equals minus 4.9 left parenthesis x minus 3 right parenthesis squared . Dividing both sides of this equation by negative 4.9 yields 9 equals left parenthesis x minus 3 right parenthesis squared . Taking the square root of both sides of this equation yields two equations: 3 equals x minus 3 and negative 3 equals x minus 3 . Adding 3 to both sides of the equation 3 equals x minus 3 yields 6 equals x . Adding 3 to both sides of the equation negative 3 equals x minus 3 yields 0 equals x . Since 0 seconds after the launch represents the time at which the projectile was launched, 6 must be the number of seconds the model estimates that the projectile will return to a height of 7 meters. Alternate approach: It's given that a quadratic function models the projectile's height, in meters, above the ground in terms of the time, in seconds, after it was launched. It's also given that the model estimates that the projectile was launched from an initial height of 7 meters above the ground and reached a maximum height of 51.1 meters above the ground 3 seconds after the launch. Since the model is quadratic, and quadratic functions are symmetric, the model estimates that for any given height less than the maximum height, the time the projectile takes to travel from the given height to the maximum height is the same as the time the projectile takes to travel from the maximum height back to the given height. Thus, since the model estimates the projectile took 3 seconds to travel from 7 meters above the ground to its maximum height of 51.1 meters above the ground, the model also estimates the projectile will take 3 more seconds to travel from its maximum height of 51.1 meters above the ground back to 7 meters above the ground. Thus, the model estimates that the projectile will return to a height of 7 meters 3 seconds after it reaches its maximum height, which is 6 seconds after the launch. Choice A is incorrect. The model estimates that 3 seconds after the launch, the projectile reached a height of 51.1 meters, not 7 meters. Choice C is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors. Choice D is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors."

Substituting 55 t minus 2 t squared for f left parenthesis t right parenthesis in g left parenthesis t right parenthesis equals f left parenthesis t right parenthesis plus 3 yields g left parenthesis t right parenthesis equals 55 t minus 2 t squared plus 3 , or g left parenthesis t right parenthesis equals minus 2 t squared plus 55 t plus 3 . The maximum value of g left parenthesis t right parenthesis can be found by completing the square to rewrite the equation defining g in the form g left parenthesis t right parenthesis equals a left parenthesis t minus h right parenthesis squared plus k , where the maximum value of the function is k , which occurs when t equals h , and a is a negative constant.

Thus, the maximum value of g left parenthesis t right parenthesis is 3 plus 2 left parenthesis StartFraction 55 Over 4 EndFraction right parenthesis squared . Alternate approach: Since the function f is a quadratic function, the maximum value of f left parenthesis t right parenthesis occurs at the value of t that’s halfway between the two zeros of the function. The zeros of function f can be found by substituting 0 for f left parenthesis t right parenthesis in the equation defining f , which yields 0 equals 55 t minus 2 t squared . This equation can be rewritten as 0 equals t left parenthesis 55 minus 2 t right parenthesis . By the zero product property, it follows that t equals 0 or 55 minus 2 t equals 0 . Subtracting 55 from each side of the equation 55 minus 2 t equals 0 yields minus 2 t equals negative 55 . Dividing each side of this equation by negative 2 yields t equals StartFraction 55 Over 2 EndFraction . Therefore, the zeros of function f are 0 and StartFraction 55 Over 2 EndFraction . The value that’s halfway between 0 and StartFraction 55 Over 2 EndFraction can be found by calculating the average of 0 and StartFraction 55 Over 2 EndFraction , which is StartStartFraction 0 plus StartFraction 55 Over 2 EndFraction OverOver 2 EndEndFraction , or StartFraction 55 Over 4 EndFraction .

If a is positive, the parabola will open upward, and if a is negative, the parabola will open downward. It’s given that the parabola has vertex left parenthesis 9 comma negative 14 right parenthesis . Substituting 9 for h and negative 14 for k in the equation y equals a left parenthesis x minus h right parenthesis squared plus k gives y equals a left parenthesis x minus 9 right parenthesis squared minus 14 , which can be rewritten as y equals a left parenthesis x minus 9 right parenthesis left parenthesis x minus 9 right parenthesis minus 14 , or y equals a left parenthesis x squared minus 18 x plus 81 right parenthesis minus 14 . Distributing the factor of a on the right-hand side of this equation yields y equals a x squared minus 18 a x plus 81 a minus 14 .

Since the vertex of the parabola, left parenthesis 9 comma negative 14 right parenthesis , is below the x -axis, and it’s given that the parabola intersects the x -axis at two points, the parabola must open upward.

It's also given that the table shows three values of x and their corresponding values of y , where y equals f left parenthesis x right parenthesis plus 4 . Substituting a left parenthesis x minus h right parenthesis squared plus k for f left parenthesis x right parenthesis in this equation yields y equals a left parenthesis x minus h right parenthesis squared plus k plus 4 . This equation represents a quadratic relationship between x and y , where k plus 4 is either the maximum or the minimum value of y , which occurs when x equals h . For quadratic relationships between x and y , the maximum or minimum value of y occurs at the value of x halfway between any two values of x that have the same corresponding value of y . The table shows that x -values of 21 and 25 correspond to the same y -value, negative 8 . Since 23 is halfway between 21 and 25 , the maximum or minimum value of y occurs at an x -value of 23 . The table shows that when x equals 23 , y equals 8 . It follows that h equals 23 and k plus 4 equals 8 . Subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation k plus 4 equals 8 yields k equals 4 . Substituting 23 for h and 4 for k in the equation y equals a left parenthesis x minus h right parenthesis squared plus k plus 4 yields y equals a left parenthesis x minus 23 right parenthesis squared plus 4 plus 4 , or y equals a left parenthesis x minus 23 right parenthesis squared plus 8 . The value of a can be found by substituting any x -value and its corresponding y -value for x and y , respectively, in this equation. Substituting 25 for x and negative 8 for y in this equation yields negative 8 equals a left parenthesis 25 minus 23 right parenthesis squared plus 8 , or negative 8 equals a left parenthesis 2 right parenthesis squared plus 8 . Subtracting 8 from both sides of this equation yields negative 16 equals a left parenthesis 2 right parenthesis squared , or negative 16 equals 4 a . Dividing both sides of this equation by 4 yields negative 4 equals a . Substituting negative 4 for a , 23 for h , and 4 for k in the equation f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals a left parenthesis x minus h right parenthesis squared plus k yields f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals minus 4 left parenthesis x minus 23 right parenthesis squared plus 4 .

Substituting 0 for t and 40 for upper C in the equation upper C equals upper K a Superscript t yields 40 equals upper K a Superscript 0 , or 40 equals upper K . It's also given that the number of comments on the article at the end of an hour had increased by 190 percent sign of the number of comments on the article at the end of the previous hour. Multiplying the percent increase by the number of comments on the article at the end of the previous hour yields the number of estimated additional comments the article has on its home page: left parenthesis 40 right parenthesis left parenthesis StartFraction 190 Over 100 EndFraction right parenthesis , or 76 comments. Thus, the estimated number of comments for the following hour is the sum of the comments from the end of the previous hour and the number of additional comments, which is 40 plus 76 , or 116 . This means that when t equals 1 , upper C equals 116 . Substituting 1 for t , 116 for upper C , and 40 for upper K in the equation upper C equals upper K a Superscript t yields 116 equals 40 a Superscript 1 , or 116 equals 40 a . Dividing both sides of this equation by 40 yields 2.9 equals a . Substituting 40 for upper K and 2.9 for a in the equation upper C equals upper K a Superscript t yields upper C equals 40 left parenthesis 2.9 right parenthesis Superscript t . Thus, the equation that best represents this model is upper C equals 40 left parenthesis 2.9 right parenthesis Superscript t . Choice A is incorrect. This model represents a situation where the number of comments at the end of each hour increased by 19 percent sign of the number of comments at the end of the previous hour, rather than 190 percent sign . Choice B is incorrect. This model represents a situation where the number of comments at the end of each hour increased by 90 percent sign of the number of comments at the end of the previous hour, rather than 190 percent sign . Choice C is incorrect. This model represents a situation where the number of comments at the end of each hour was 19 times the number of comments at the end of the previous hour, rather than increasing by 190 percent sign of the number of comments at the end of the previous hour."

Adding w to both sides of this equation yields 7 equals w . Therefore, 7 is one possible value of w . Setting the second factor equal to 0 yields 5 minus w equals 0 . Adding w to both sides of this equation yields 5 equals w . Therefore, 5 is a second possible value of w . Setting the third factor equal to 0 yields left parenthesis 13 minus w right parenthesis squared equals 0 . Taking the square root of both sides of this equation yields 13 minus w equals 0 . Adding w to both sides of this equation yields 13 equals w . Therefore, 13 is a third possible value of w . Adding the three possible values of w yields 7 plus 5 plus 13 , or 25 . Therefore, the sum of all possible values of w is 25 ."

The mean of a data set is the sum of the values in the data set divided by the number of values in the data set. The new data set consists of the weights of the 71 tortoises in the original data set and one additional weight, 39 . Since the additional weight, 39 , is greater than any of the values in the original data set, the mean of the new data set is greater than the mean of the original data set. If a data set contains an odd number of data values, the median is represented by the middle data value in the list when the data values are listed in ascending or descending order. Since the original data set consists of the weights of 71 tortoises and is in ascending order, the median of the original data set is represented by the middle value, or the 36th value. Based on the frequencies shown in the table, the 36th value in this data set is 17 . If a data set contains an even number of data values, the median is between the two middle data values when the values are listed in ascending or descending order. Since the new data set consists of the weights of 72 tortoises, the median of the new data set is between the 36th and 37th data values when the values are arranged in ascending order. To keep the data in ascending order, the additional value of 39 would be placed at the bottom of the frequency table with a frequency of 1 . Therefore, based on the frequencies in the table, the 36th and 37th values in the new data set are both 17 . It follows that the median of the new data set is 17 , which is the same as the median of the original data set. Therefore, the mean of the new data set is greater than the mean of the original data set, and the medians of the two data sets are equal.

The maximum value in data set A is 26 and the minimum value is 22 , so the range of data set A is 26 minus 22 , or 4 . It’s given that data set B is created by adding 56 to each of the values in data set A. Increasing each of the 15 values in data set A by 56 will also increase its median value by 56 making the median of data set B 79 . Increasing each value of data set A by 56 does not change the range, since the maximum value of data set B is 26 plus 56 , or 82 , and the minimum value is 22 plus 56 , or 78 , making the range of data set B 82 minus 78 , or 4 .

It's given that the radius of the circle is 168 millimeters. Since points upper M and upper N both lie on the circle, segments upper G upper M and upper G upper N are both radii. Therefore, segments upper G upper M and upper G upper N each have length 168 millimeters. Two segments that are tangent to a circle and have a common exterior endpoint have equal length. Therefore, segment upper M upper H and segment upper N upper H have equal length. Let x represent the length of segment upper M upper H . Then x also represents the length of segment upper N upper H . It's given that the perimeter of quadrilateral upper G upper M upper H upper N is 3,856 millimeters. Since the perimeter of a quadrilateral is equal to the sum of the lengths of the sides of the quadrilateral, 3,856 equals 168 plus 168 plus x plus x , or 3,856 equals 336 plus 2 x . Subtracting 336 from both sides of this equation yields 3,520 equals 2 x , and dividing both sides of this equation by 2 yields 1,760 equals x . Therefore, the length of segment upper M upper H is 1,760 millimeters. A line segment that's tangent to a circle is perpendicular to the radius of the circle at the point of tangency. Therefore, segment upper G upper M is perpendicular to segment upper M upper H . Since perpendicular segments form right angles, angle upper G upper M upper H is a right angle. Therefore, triangle upper G upper M upper H is a right triangle with legs of length 1,760 millimeters and 168 millimeters, and hypotenuse upper G upper H . By the Pythagorean theorem, if a right triangle has a hypotenuse with length c and legs with lengths a and b , then a squared plus b squared equals c squared . Substituting 1,760 for a and 168 for b in this equation yields 1,760 squared plus 168 squared equals c squared , or 3,125,824 equals c squared . Taking the square root of both sides of this equation yields plus or minus 1,768 equals c . Since c represents a length, which must be positive, the value of c is 1,768 .
